					<h3>Resilience: The Basics</h3>
					The American Psychological Association (APA) defines resilience as
					&quot;the ability to adapt well in the face of adversity, trauma,
					tragedy, threats, or other significant sources of stress.&quot;
					(APA, 2008). Resilience helps with life&apos;s challenges and
					provides the ability to quickly bounce back from adversity.
					Resilience is not something that you either &quot;have&quot; or
					&quot;don&apos;t have&quot; like muscle strength or physical
					endurance. Resilience is the way you approach a situation. And,
					like muscle strength, resilience can be strengthened through
					repetition and practice. Like the personal protective equipment
					issued to members of the military aimed at coping with harsh
					environmental conditions, resilience protects against the negative
					effects of stress. Read on to learn about strategies for practicing
					and strengthening your resiliency.

					<h3>Be Assertive In Personal Relationships</h3>
					<p>
						Communicating <i>assertively</i> means standing up for yourself
						and your rights without feeling guilty. Assertion allows you to
						navigate conflicts when they arise, taking responsibility for
						getting your needs met in a way that respects and considers
						others. Done correctly, assertive communication serves to maintain
						positive relationships through successful problem solving and good
						communication. Being assertive does <span class="underlined_text">not</span>
						mean being pushy or aggressive. After a stressful experience such
						as a combat deployment, it may be difficult to communicate clearly
						either at work or in a close, perhaps complex relationship. Being
						adaptable (resilient) requires that you express what you think,
						feel, or believe in a way that will get you the outcome you want
						while solving problems and maintaining good relationships. Using
						assertive communication in relationships involves three skills:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><i>Accurately</i> communicating how you feel.</li>
						<li><i>Respectfully</i> communicating what you want or need.</li>
						<li><i>Saying no</i> in the face of requests or demands that
							you determine are not in your best interest.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Resolve Conflicts</h3>
					<p>
						<i>Conflict Resolution</i> is a set of structured guidelines for
						settling disagreements. The primary goal is to arrive at a
						solution that is acceptable to all parties. Conflicts don&apos;t
						have to have a winner or a loser.
					</p>
					<p>Developing conflict resolution skills will increase the
						likelihood that you will be able to solve disputes amicably.
						Effective conflict resolution has the net effect of improving
						communication and increasing future cooperation should conflict
						re-occur. Conflict resolution skills can be used with both serious
						and casual relationships.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>The Eight Steps of Conflict Resolution</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>STEP 1: <b><i>Define the conflict.</i>
						</b> There may be an impulse to solve a conflict <span
							class="underlined_text">before</span> obtaining a thorough
							understanding of the dispute. Understanding the underlying cause
							of the conflict will help you define it more clearly. Begin by
							defining the conflict objectively, including how you feel about
							the problem, and who specifically is being affected by the
							conflict.</li>
						<li>STEP 2: <b><i>Identify the thoughts and feelings.</i>
						</b> Make a point of identifying what you were thinking and feeling
							both during and after the conflict. Recognition that the conflict
							has been upsetting will serve as motivation to solve the problem.
						</li>
						<li>STEP 3: <b><i>Identify the consequences.</i>
						</b> Identify the conflict&apos;s negative consequences, and the
							positive outcomes of getting the problem resolved for both you
							and the other person. <span class="underlined_text">Be
								specific.</span> Consider the negative consequences for others who are
							not directly involved in the conflict. If the conflict is between
							you and your spouse, how are your children affected?</li>
						<li>STEP 4: <b><i>Decide whether to resolve the
									conflict.</i>
						</b> When the conflict is understood (see Steps 1 and 2), decide
							whether resolving it is something you want to put time and effort
							into. Approach the other person only if the conflict still feels
							like a problem, or if it will get worse or you will feel
							resentment if you don&apos;t address it.</li>
						<li>STEP 5: <b><i>Set up a time to talk.</i>
						</b> Don&apos;t jump into a conversation; instead, give the other
							party time to prepare. Attempting to resolve a conflict when
							communication time is limited will probably result in a negative
							outcome. Pick a neutral location at a time when neither you nor
							the other party will be stressed, tired, or preoccupied.</li>
						<li>STEP 6: <b><i>Present your concerns.</i>
						</b> Once a time has been set, be prepared to discuss your
							understanding of the problem and how it makes you feel. Give the
							other person a chance to respond; even if you disagree with their
							viewpoint, be sure to be respectful. If you don&apos;t understand
							something, ask for clarification.</li>
						<li>STEP 7: <b><i>Listen to the other&apos;s point of
									view.</i>
						</b> After you&apos;ve stated your case assertively, listen carefully
							to the other person&apos;s response. Don&apos;t get angry if they
							voice complaints and requests of their own. <span
							class="underlined_text">Active</span> listening involves
							indicating that you&apos;re carefully considering what&apos;s
							being said. Give nonverbal feedback, such as nodding and eye
							contact.</li>
						<li>STEP 8: <b><i>Negotiate a solution.</i>
						</b> When you&apos;re negotiating a solution to a problem, the goal
							isn&apos;t to get the best outcome only for yourself; the goal is
							for both sides to get their reasonable needs met. Negotiating a
							solution may involve making compromises or jointly brainstorming
							solutions that had not previously been on the table. The goal is
							to reach a solution such that no one feels as if they
							&quot;lost&quot; in the process. It may take more than one
							session to solve the conflict. If so, be sure to set a time to
							meet again. You may also want to consider involving a neutral
							person to join the discussion.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Although working through these steps takes time and effort,
						doing so will save time in the long run. Negative behaviors that
						grow out of conflicts, such as avoiding the other person, or
						working at cross-purposes, no longer interfere with important
						activities. You can return to the tasks at hand with your full
						attention.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Think Realistically</h3>
					<p>
						<i>Realistic</i> thinking requires that your beliefs don&apos;t
						interfere with your ability to see clearly. Your thoughts are like
						the lens of a telescope: a clear lens allows you to see the world
						around you accurately. But if the lens is cracked or broken your
						view of the world will be distorted.
					</p>
					<p>
						When thoughts filter through a cracked lens, the ability to
						respond to the world <i>as it actually</i> is becomes compromised.
						The fewer the distortions (the clearer the lens!), the better we
						communicate, solve problems, and get along with others.
					</p>
					<p>It&apos;s easier to see the distorted thinking of others. In
						fact, conflict often arises when we attempt to point out
						another&apos;s distorted thinking.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>How To Be Realistically Optimistic</h3>
					<p>Optimism is a set of beliefs that help to focus attention on
						life&apos;s opportunities. Optimism is not a rose-colored lens;
						it&apos;s a clear lens, without distortion, allowing you to see
						life realistically.</p>
					<p>
						Where thinking <span class="underlined_text">optimistically</span>
						helps to identify opportunities in even traumatic circumstances,
						thinking <span class="underlined_text">pessimistically</span> can
						create a sense of threat. Both optimism and pessimism can affect
						resiliency; research has shown that optimism leads to long-term
						health benefits and greater resistance to disease.
					</p>
					<p>
						Optimism can also be <i>unrealistic</i>. Unrealistic optimism is
						much like &quot;denial&quot;. Unrealistic optimism assumes the
						best outcome even when the facts of the situation are unknown. For
						example, in a combat environment involving unknowns and sudden
						alterations in conditions, unrealistic optimism can be dangerous.
						Whereas, when the facts are clear but the meaning of an event is
						open to interpretation, realistic optimism has been shown to be
						very effective.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Seven Steps to Realistic Optimism</h3>
					Here are seven key steps to maintain an optimistic perspective on
					life.
					<ul>
						<li>Step 1 - Interpret the Events in Your Life in a Positive
							Way: Interpret the world realistically by paying attention to
							what happens in life, not what could happen.</li>
						<li>Step 2 - Focus on the Positive: Rather than dwelling on
							what could be better or what could happen, pay attention to the
							areas in your life that are going well. By concentrating on
							what&apos;s good, we&apos;re likely to be encouraged and
							motivated. This also allows you to increase the level of
							gratitude in your life, which is a characteristic of resilient
							people.</li>
						<li>Step 3 - Resist the Desire to Complain: In reality,
							complaining usually makes you feel worse by keeping your
							attention on an unhappy situation. Complaining will distance you
							from positive people and attracts negative people who further
							encourage anger, hostility and envy</li>
						<li>Step 4 - Decide for Yourself What Is and Isn&apos;t
							Possible: There are endless possibilities to achieve a specific
							goal. Of course not everything is possible; but there are many
							things you may dismiss too easily. If you think or say something
							is &quot;impossible&quot; or &quot;can&apos;t be done&quot;
							learning to think outside the box can teach you how to achieve
							your goal and that anything is possible if you put your mind to
							it.</li>
						<li>Step 5 - Be For Things, Not Against Things: When you are
							against something you are focused on creating less. This often
							requires attacking, punishing, complaining and reacting. When you
							are for something your focus is on creating more. Creating more
							is about new ideas, options, and productivity. This is a critical
							piece of developing optimism</li>
						<li>Step 6 - Laugh at Yourself: Humor can be used in all
							kinds of situations. Humor can remind us that many solutions we
							thought were foolproof in the past weren&apos;t. Think back at
							what you thought to be absolutely true ten years ago. Has any of
							that changed? Can you laugh at it now? Avoid the pessimist&apos;s
							use of cynicism and sarcasm as a substitute for genuine humor.</li>
						<li>Step 7 - Fake It Until You Make It: This is a catchphrase
							that you can remember when you are feeling less than confident.
							When you &quot;act as if&quot; you imitate confidence which
							generate real confidence. . The goal is to practice each step
							even if it feels awkward. The best strategy for behavior change
							is to change behavior first, and let your feelings about it catch
							up. If you wait to change your behavior until you&apos;re
							comfortable, you may never change.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Practice Forgiveness</h3>
					<p>Forgiveness can be the process of concluding negative
						feelings (anger, resentment, being wronged or denied) of a
						perceived offense directed at you or someone you care about. The
						act that hurt you or offended you may always remain a part of your
						life, but forgiveness can lessen its hold on you and allow you to
						focus on positive parts of your life. Forgiveness can lead to
						feelings of understanding and compassion for the one who hurt you.
					</p>
					<p>Forgiveness doesn&apos;t involve rationalizing or denying
						the other person&apos;s misbehavior and it doesn&apos;t minimize
						or justify the wrong. You can forgive a person without excusing
						their misbehavior and in doing so bring a kind of peace that will
						help you go on with life. Forgiveness can lead to healthier
						relationships, lower anxiety and blood pressure and fewer symptoms
						of depression.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Steps to Practice Forgiveness</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Identify negative feelings you have toward other people.
							Try starting small with one person who showed hurtful behavior
							toward you that you&apos;d like to forgive. As you let go of a
							grudge or bitterness you&apos;ll no longer define your life by
							how you&apos;ve been hurt.</li>
						<li>Keep in mind misbehavior is often pain in disguise.
							Practicing forgiveness is also learning to see the pain behind a
							person&apos;s actions. This takes patience and the ability to
							practice compassion toward those that have been hurtful to you.</li>
						<li>Determine whether the goal is forgiveness, or forgiveness
							and restoring the relationship (reconciliation). Reconciliation
							requires more than forgiveness. Consider reconciliation to be
							your goal if:
							<ul>
								<li>They acknowledge their misbehavior and apologize. An
									apology is a promise - a promise not to repeat the misbehavior
									again.
								<li>They ask for forgiveness.</li>
							</ul></li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Be Grateful</h3>
					<p>Gratitude is a positive emotion. When you understand and
						acknowledge the good experiences you have in life, small or large,
						are not owed to you, but are gifts you respond in a positive way,
						often thankfulness, gratefulness or appreciation. Gratitude has
						been shown to have very positive effects on enthusiasm, energy,
						and well-being.</p>
					<span class="underlined_text">Tips On How To Increase
						Gratitude</span>
					<ul>
						<li><i>Begin each day with a two minute gratitude
								session.</i> Find a quiet space of two minutes, close your eyes if
							possible, and bring to mind the things and people in your life
							you are grateful for</li>
						<li><i>Create a short prayer or affirmation.</i> Use this on
							a daily basis to remind yourself that you have worked and planned
							for what you have and are appreciative of your life.</li>
						<li><i>Use a Daily Gratitude Journal.</i> Write at least five
							things that you are thankful for on a daily basis. Your entries
							can be short or long. To begin, make a commitment to do this for
							at least two weeks with a new entry each day. You may find that
							this will help draw your attention to the many small gifts that
							come into your life.</li>
						<li><i>Write a Gratitude Letter.</i> Identify a person to
							whom you are thankful for and take a few minutes to write a
							letter expressing your gratitude...</li>
						<li><i>Recognize and seek out new things to be grateful
								for.</i> Pay attention to the beauty that you are surrounded by all
							the time - new friendships, a sunset, flowers blooming in a
							garden or children playing in a park..</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Be Generous</h3>
					<p>Generosity is the act of giving freely of yourself (time,
						money, labor, or talents) to someone in need without expecting
						anything in return. Research has documented that the act of giving
						can actually increase activity in the pleasure centers of the
						brain, increase longevity, decrease chronic pain, decrease
						depressive symptoms, lower rates of heart disease and improve the
						body&apos;s immune response. Generosity has also been a key
						component of interventions for troubled children and youth.
						Troubled youth learn to look and reach outside themselves and
						focus on something other than personal challenges and enjoy being
						a positive influence in their communities. The practice of
						generosity is exactly that, practice. On a daily basis one can be
						generous simply by opening the door for someone, smiling at a
						passerby, giving a small gift or donating to a local charity.
						Generosity can become harmful and is not defined as generosity
						when:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Giving is done at significant personal cost of health or
							well-being</li>
						<li>Giving is done to manipulate or create guilt in the
							receiver</li>
					</ul>
					While generosity is an observable behavior, its effect on
					increasing personal resilience is associated with empathy and
					compassion. This is one reason why acts such as giving money out of
					a sense of obligation or donating your time and feeling angry about
					it provides no increase in resilience. The physiological benefits
					of generosity are self-generated.
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Develop Personal Strengths And Values</h3>
					<p>Personal strengths and values are aspects of your character
						that define what&apos;s best about you. Identifying and using your
						strengths are resilience skills that support the capacity to cope
						with the challenges in your life. Examples of personal strengths
						include: creativity, honesty, leadership, modesty, generosity,
						loyalty, and optimism. (There are many more.)</p>
					<p>Throughout history, great men and women have learned how to
						act by watching the actions of others whom they admired. The
						easiest way to develop a new strength is to learn from someone who
						possesses that strength. For example, think of someone who has a
						feature you admire. This person can be someone you know, a public
						figure, a famous person from the past, or even a fictional
						character from a novel, movie, or TV series. Select one or two
						ways you could imitate them and practice this strength in your
						life.</p>
					<p>It&apos;s important that you use your personal strengths and
						share them in ways that will improve your work, your personal life
						and your community to be resilient.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Set Goals</h3>
					<p>Goals are desired situations, events, or &quot;things we
						want to have happen&quot; and we are willing to exert some effort
						to achieve the desired outcome. It is the effort put forth that
						makes a goal different from a &quot;wish&quot; or simply hoping
						that something will happen.</p>
					<p>As a part of the military community, you have continuously
						set and worked towards goals. You most likely have goals for
						professional development, personal life, fitness, family, or
						education. You have immediate goals, like tackling your spring
						cleaning and you have long-term goals, like saving for retirement.
						Although your goals may vary from another person&apos;s the
						process we all go through to set and accomplish our goals is very
						similar. Here are six simple steps you can take to accomplish your
						goals:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Identify Your Goals.</b> The goals that inspire you
							most will be based on your values and what's on whats really
							important to you. Sit down and write these out..</li>
						<li><b>Prioritize Your Goals.</b> Putting your goals in order
							of importance is necessary because it will help you focus your
							efforts.</li>
						<li><b>Break Larger Goals into Small, Bite-Sized Steps.</b>
							Break your goals into smaller steps, consider the resources that
							you will need, such as time, money, equipment, computers, and
							people. For long term goals, it is helpful to set many small,
							short-term goals and then break each of those goals into steps.
							By doing so, you will feel closer to reaching your long-term goal
							by making continual progress.</li>
						<li><b>Share Your Goal With Someone.</b> Sharing your goal
							creates a sense of accountability and provides a place to discuss
							your progress or things that may be getting in your way..</li>
						<li><b>Implement Your Plan.</b> Once you have prioritized and
							made a plan, the next step is to take action. Start by setting a
							day and time to start working toward your goal, and mark it on
							your calendar. Create a checklist or a chart to help you track
							your progress and setbacks.</li>
						<li><b>Monitor Your Plan And Revise Or Make Changes As
								Needed.</b> Once you have implemented your plan, keep track of what
							you are doing and monitor your progress to make sure you are
							being effective.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Manage Your Time</h3>
					<p>Time management is one Resilience skill that can keep you
						from expending unnecessary energy on coping with stress. When we
						are feeling stressed out, many times this is because we have too
						many things to do and not enough time.</p>
					<p>Resilient people don&apos;t think in terms of time, they
						think in terms of priorities. They know there is only so much
						time, and it&apos;s the same every day. It never expands or
						shrinks. Resilient people never think &quot;I don&apos;t have
						time&quot;, they are honest with themselves and acknowledge the
						real truth, &quot;This is lower on my list of priorities&quot;.
						So, while there is no such thing as 'not enough time,&apos; there
						is such a thing as setting your priorities (What comes First?
						Second? Next?).</p>
					Here are some tips for managing your priorities
					<ul>
						<li>Identify your important day-to-day maintenance tasks.</li>
						<li>Add one priority that supports or reflects your personal
							values.</li>
						<li>Identify which optional tasks you will choose as your
							'Active Priorities&apos;.</li>
						<li>Make delegating tasks one of your priorities.</li>
						<li>Evaluate what you actually did at the end of the day
							these were your real priorities.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Use Active Problem Solving</h3>
					<p>Effective problem-solving is a sign of the ability to
						successfully adapt to stressful situations. While there is
						definitely a set of skills you can use to solve problems,
						there&apos;s also an attitude that affects your success at solving
						problems. When you&apos;re faced with a problem, your attitude and
						thoughts influence how you respond to that problem. This can
						influence the outcome of the situation.</p>
					A resilient attitude toward problems means that you:
					<ul>
						<li>Assume challenges are a normal part of life.</li>
						<li>Recognize that you are able to cope with these
							situations.</li>
						<li>Identify these circumstances as they occur.</li>
						<li>Avoid the tendency to respond on impulse. Instead, take a
							moment to think, weigh your options, and then make a decision.</li>
					</ul>
					Active problem solvers are flexible and can adapt to a situation.
					They set and then work towards goals in a logical progression. If a
					solution is not working, they can shift to a different strategy
					easily. People who engage in passive coping avoid addressing the
					changes and challenges in life directly. This world view responds
					to life&apos;s difficulties through avoidance, withdrawal,
					pessimism, and deferral to others. Passive coping is often
					accompanied by substance abuse, wishful thinking, denial, blaming,
					distraction, rumination, following others&apos; leads, and relying
					on others excessively. Because passive coping tends to interfere
					with reaching goals, this world view is self-reinforcing,
					confirming the belief in powerlessness.
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Active Problem Solving Steps</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Step 1: <b><i>Identify the problem.</i>
						</b> The first step is identifying the problem that you want to solve.
							This may seem obvious, but stopping to define the problem
							requires that you shift your attention away from your emotions
							toward a more practical or accurate analysis of the situation</li>
						<li>Step 2: <b><i>Set a goal.</i>
						</b> The second step in problem-solving is to set a goal for dealing
							with the problem. The goal should be very specific and something
							within your power to achieve.</li>
						<li>Step 3: <b><i>Brainstorm solutions.</i>
						</b> Write down all possible solutions to the problem that could
							satisfy the goal you set.</li>
						<li>Step 4: <b><i>Evaluate solutions.</i>
						</b> The next step is to evaluate each of your possible solutions.
							Eliminate any alternatives that you don&apos;t want to pursue.
							Weigh the pros and cons of each solution.</li>
						<li>Step 5: <b><i>Choose a solution.</i>
						</b> The next step is to choose the best solution. Sometimes pure
							facts dictate which ideas will work and which will not. In other
							situations, you may need to rely on feelings to decide, or a
							combination of facts and intuition. If you end up with no
							solutions that work, you will need to repeat the brainstorming
							step to discover more potential solutions. Or, you might consider
							re-defining the problem, in case you weren&apos;t able to find a
							solution because the problem was not properly identified.</li>
						<li>Step 6: <b><i>Make an action plan and try it.</i>
						</b> The sixth step is to make a plan to put the solution into action.
							To do this, devise a specific plan to implement your solution.
							You may need to divide the plan into steps.</li>
						<li>Step 7: <b><i>Assess your success.</i>
						</b> After giving your solution a fair try, the next step is to decide
							if it worked. Did you meet your goal? If you didn&apos;t meet
							your goal, ask yourself: Was the plan realistic? Should the plan
							be changed?</li>
						<li>Step 8: <b><i>If it didn&apos;t work, try
									another.</i>
						</b> If you did not meet your goals and solve the problem, the next
							step is to choose a different solution and try again. You can go
							back to your list of solutions and select the next-best option.
							Or if nothing from your list seems to help, you may not have
							identified the problem correctly. In this case, you can go back
							to step 1 and see if there are other, more helpful ways to think
							about the problem you&apos;re facing.</li>
					</ul>
					<b><span class="underlined_text">What Did You Learn?</span>
					</b> Lastly, consider whether you gained new knowledge, understanding,
					or skills in addressing this problem. Part of being resilient is
					seeing challenges as opportunities to learn and grow, so that
					similar challenges won&apos;t be as hard next time you face them.
					Can you see what you have learned from the difficulties you
					encountered, even if they were unpleasant? Problem solving helps
					you respond thoughtfully, instead of reacting impulsively; this, in
					turn, is associated with resilience, and with higher rates of
					success in addressing challenges.
