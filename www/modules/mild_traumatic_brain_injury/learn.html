					<h3>Sleep Basics</h3>
					<p>An injury to the head is called a traumatic brain injury or
						"TBI." But more than just a hit to the head, a TBI has the
						potentional to affect brain functioning. In other words, the brain
						temporarily stops working in its usual way. A TBI might cause an
						individual to become dazed, or experience a period of
						unconsciousness. There may be difficulty remembering what happened
						right before or after the injury.</p>
					<p>The severity of a TBI can range from mild (feeling "dazed"
						or being unconscious for a short period of time) to severe ( a
						longer period of unconsciousness or inability to remember the
						injury). Individuals who experience head injuries have described
						the experience as "seeing stars," or "getting my bell rung," or
						"getting knocked out."</p>

					<h3>Are Concussions The Same As TBI</h3>
					<p>
						While the terms "concussion" and "<i>mild</i> traumatic brain
						injury," (mTBI) mean the same thing, some brain injuries can be
						more severe than a concussion (therefore more severe than a <i>mild</i>
						TBI). An individual who has been concussed may try to walk off the
						effects of the concussion and continue with activities. Walking
						off the effects of a concussion has the potential to increase the
						risk of further injury.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you've been diagnosed with a TBI, your provider has probably
						discussed the level of severity of your injury. The Head Injury
						Severity table below outlines the differences between mild,
						moderate, and severe. Note that these severity factors are
						measured <span class="underlined_text">at the time of
							injury</span>, not minutes, days, or months after the fact.

					<h3>How is TBI Diagnosed?</h3>
					<p>
						First, only medically trained specialists can determine if someone
						has a TBI. In fact, a concussion or TBI can be difficult to
						diagnose, especially if there are no visible or external signs of
						the injury. Concussions are most commonly diagnosed via an
						interview by a medically trained specialist. Doctors may also use
						CT scans, x-rays of the skull, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
						and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). However,
						85% of concussions are <span class="underlined_text">not</span>
						detected using these tests. Many clinicians rely on interview
						data, meeting with the patient and his family and friends, along
						with monitoring symptoms with questionaires and tests.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>So How Long Does It Take To Heal?</h3>
					<p>The effects of a concussion are usually temporary and
						disappear after a few weeks. When symptoms do not go away
						naturally, there may be complicating factors, including other
						physical injuries and even mood and anxiety problems such as
						depression and post-traumatic stress. Generally, the longer the
						period of unconsciousness at the time of the injury, the longer
						the period of recovery.</p>
					<p>
						TBI symptoms that are <i>moderate</i> in severity may linger for
						months. In military settings, many service members with a moderate
						TBI can return to active duty, while others will need to retire
						from the military. For the best outcome, moderate TBI requires
						treatment by a team of medical providers. Symptoms can generally
						be managed with a regimen of medication, counseling, and learning
						strategies.
					</p>
					<p>
						<i>Severe</i> TBI often results in long-term nursing care and
						difficulty with independent fuctioning.
					</p>

					<h3>What Happens After A Concussion</h3>
					<p>The difficulties associated with a concussion can be grouped
						into three categories:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Problems with thinking ability - memory, concentration,
							focusing.</li>
						<li>Problems with moods and behaviors - depression, anxiety,
							irritability, sleep issues.</li>
						<li>Problems with body and senses - headache, fatigue, vision
							problems, dizziness</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Because the signs and symptoms of a concussion can be
						subtle, they can be overlooked by patients, family members, and
						health care professionals. Concussions can be different from one
						person to the next, in this respect, some individuals experience
						many symptoms while others experience fewer. Having multiple
						symptoms doesn't necessarily mean having a more difficult recovery
						- many factors influence recovery time from a concussion,
						including flexibility, goal-setting, and social support.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Will a TBI Affect My Day-To-Day Life?</h3>
					<p>
						Your day-to-day life may be affected very little by the
						concussion. But understanding the many symptoms that occur
						following a concussion is crucial to being able to take control of
						your recovery. "Symptoms" are just labels for how the mind and
						body are working less than optimally, the important determination
						is identifying how the symptoms affect <span
							class="underlined_text">day-to-day activities</span> (<i>secondary
							problems</i>)
					</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>What Can I Do To Thrive After My Concussion?</h3>
					<p>Following a concussion, it's best to be realistic about how
						quickly you'll get better and what must be done to support your
						recovery. Some hear the term "brain injury" and think "brain
						damage." Framing the problem this way can lead to feeling
						hopeless. In reality, brain injuries are like many other injuries.
						For example, to treat a broken foot, a physician will recommend
						crutches and instruct that weight-bearing should be avoided until
						the foot is healed. The same idea applies with concussion - the
						brain needs time to rest and heal.</p>
