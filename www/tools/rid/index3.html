				The final step is to <strong>Decide</strong> what to do now. If you
				feel stressed, you can decrease the trigger's power by deciding to
				stay in the moment. You will find that you are able to handle the
				trigger after all. Your stress will go down the longer you stay in
				the moment. But, if your trigger made you very angry, your best bet
				is to take a time-out and leave the moment (see the <u>Time Out</u>
				tool for help). If you are in danger of hurting yourself for others,
				seek support right away, don't take any chances!
