			<h1>Gratitude</h1>
			<p>Description: Research shows that gratitude is essential for
				leading a happy life. This tool can help you increase feelings of
				gratitude.</p>
			<p>Gratitude is a decision to see the good things in life as
				gifts, and a decision to have an attitude of thanks. It is the
				opposite of seeing good things as owed to us, or taking good things
				for granted. An attitude of gratefulness is the most important thing
				we can do to increase happiness. Therefore, it is important to learn
				ways to be grateful.</p>

			Research shows that the positive effects of gratitude are multiplied
			as you increase the following:
			<ul>
				<li>The strength of your sense of gratitude</li>
				<li>How often you feel grateful</li>
				<li>The number of things you are grateful for</li>
				<li>The number of people you are grateful for</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Try this technique:</p>
			<p>Gratitude Letter</p>
			<p>Think of a person you are grateful for. It could be someone
				who did something important for you, or a person you are thankful to
				simply have in your life. Take a few minutes to write a letter
				expressing your gratitude for this person. Write about the
				importance of their relationship with you. Try to be as specific as
				possible about the good things they have done for you or the
				specific ways they have positively affected your life. It's your
				decision if you actually want to deliver the letter. The most
				important thing is not that the person gets the letter, but that you
				take on a grateful attitude toward life. You can do this technique
				whenever you feel unhappy, and whenever you want to express your
				gratitude toward the important people in your life.</p>
