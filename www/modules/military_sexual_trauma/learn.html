					<h3>What Is Sexual Harassment?</h3>
					<p>Sexual harassment is unwelcome verbal or physical conduct of
						a sexual nature that occurs in the workplace or an academic or
						training setting. Sexual harassment includes gender harassment
						(e.g., put you down because of your gender), unwanted sexual
						attention (e.g., made offensive remarks about your sexual
						activities or your body) and sexual coercion (e.g., implied
						special treatment if you were sexually cooperative).</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>What Is Sexual Assault?</h3>
					<p>Sexual assault is any sort of sexual activity between at
						least two people in which one of the people is involved against
						his or her will. Physical force may or may not be used. The sexual
						activity involved can include many different experiences including
						unwanted touching, grabbing, oral sex, anal sex, sexual
						penetration with an object, and/or sexual intercourse.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>The Impact Of Sexual Assault and Harassment Include:</h3>
					<p>There are a wide range of emotional reactions in response to
						Military Sexual Trauma. Even in the aftermath of severe forms of
						victimization, there is no one way that victims will respond.
						Instead, the intensity, duration, and trajectory of psychological
						responses will all vary based on previous trauma history, their
						appraisal of the traumatic event, and the quality of their support
						systems following the trauma.</p>
					<p>Sexual assault victimization is associated with high
						lifetime rates of post-traumatic stress in both men and women.
						Sexual Harassment is associated with poorer psychological
						well-being, more physical problems and lower satisfaction with
						health and work. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is another common
						reaction following sexual assault, with research suggesting that
						almost a third of sexual assault victims have at least one period
						of MDD during their lives. Victims of sexual assault may also
						report increased substance use, perhaps as a means of managing
						other psychological symptoms. In addition to these psychological
						conditions, victims of sexual trauma may continue to struggle with
						a range of other symptoms that interfere with their quality of
						life. Common emotional reactions include anger and shame, guilt or
						self-blame. Victims of sexual trauma may report problems in their
						interpersonal relationships, including difficulties with trust,
						difficulties engaging in social activities or sexual dysfunction.
						Male victims of sexual trauma may also express concern about their
						sexuality or their masculinity.</p>

					<h3>If You Are Sexually Assaulted:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Get to a safe place.</li>
						<li>Call 911-if you need immediate medical help.</li>
						<li>Call Military OneSource (1.800.345.9647) anytime to talk
							with a Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC) or Victim
							Advocate (VA).</li>
						<li>Get medical care as soon as possible. While you may not
							have visible physical injuries, you may be at risk for a sexually
							transmitted disease or pregnancy.
							<ul>
								<li>Ask healthcare personnel to conduct a Sexual Assault
									Forensic Examination (SAFE) to preserve evidence of the
									assault.</li>
								<li>If you think you&apos;ve been drugged, ask for your
									urine to be tested and provide a sample.</li>
								<li>Save all evidence of the assault. Avoid bathing,
									washing your hands or brushing your teeth before seeking
									medical care. Do not clean or straighten up the scene.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Write down or record any details you remember about the
							assault and your assailant.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>If You Are Sexually Harassed</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Stay away from your harasser and make sure you&apos;re
							not left alone with the person.</li>
						<li>Call Military OneSource (1.800.345.9647) anytime for
							confidential support or advice.</li>
						<li>Consider talking to a chaplain or a mental health
							counselor with confidentiality.</li>
						<li>Record any contact you have with your harasser. Include
							dates, times and what was said and done each time.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Assault By Known Individuals</h3>
					<p>Most victims are not raped by strangers. Up to 85% of
						rapists are known by the person they attack. "Acquaintance rape"
						by a friend or co-worker is common, especially among young single
						women. Studies find 50% of sexual assaults occur in or around a
						woman's home, and 50% happen during the day in civilian life. In
						the military, sexual assaults generally happen between Thursday
						and Sunday from the hours of 2200 to 0600.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Drinking and Sexual Assault</h3>
					<p>
						Sexual assault survivors are <span class="underlined_text">never
							responsible</span> for their assailant&apos;s behavior, no matter how
						much alcohol they&apos;ve had. Although alcohol may increase the
						risk of sexual assault it can also leave people unable to consent
						or protect themselves. Drinking is not the cause of the assault.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>How Serious is Sexual Harassment?</h3>
					<p>Sexual Harassment is not harmless flirtation and can be
						devastating to a victim. Victims often feel offended, frightened
						and insulted. Research shows victims often must leave their
						schools or jobs in order to avoid harassment. Many victims suffer
						serious psychological and health-related problems, including
						post-traumatic stress (PTS), depression, and anxiety.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>How Common Is Sexual Violence In The Military</h3>
					<p>It&apos;s difficult to give precise data on how common
						sexual assault and harassment are, because many service members
						who are assaulted or harassed do not report what happened for fear
						of being ignored, stigmatized, or retaliated against. Due to the
						fear of these retributions as few as 5-20% of sexual assaults are
						reported to an authority figure by a service member.</p>
					<p>Statistics show that 23-28% of female service members are
						sexually assaulted while in the military and 11% are raped. A
						report published in 2006 found that 6.8% of active duty women were
						sexually assaulted in a single year. Statistics of sexual
						harassment of women vary, ranging from 34%-78% of military women.
					</p>
					<p>While male sexual assault and harassment are vastly
						underreported in the military, one estimate claims 3.5% of male
						service members are sexually assaulted while in the military, and
						1.2% are raped. A 2006 report found 1.8% of active duty men were
						sexually assaulted in a single year. Statistics of sexual
						harassment vary, ranging from 6-38% of men in the military.</p>
					<p>Reporting rates continue to rise among active duty service
						members serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Historically, there are
						higher rates of assault during a war. The greater number of
						incidents may be due to the changes in policy in 2005 encouraging
						survivors to report. In the 2005 policy change, survivors can
						report and incident without opening an investigation.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Facts About Military Sexual Trauma (MST) In The Military</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The most common MST is acquaintance or date rape, also
							known as 'offender-known rape&apos;.</li>
						<li>Alcohol and unlocked barracks doors are common factors in
							MSTs of service members.</li>
						<li>Sexual assaults generally occur between Thursday and
							Sunday, and between the hours or 2200 - 0600.</li>
						<li>The majority of MSTs took place at a military work site,
							during duty hours by military personnel.</li>
						<li>The Service branch with the highest percentage of women
							reporting sexual trauma is the Marine Corps.</li>
						<li>Victims and perpetrators tend to be military personnel
							ranks E1-E4, ages 17-26 years old, and unmarried.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>What Happens When An Assault Is Reported In The Military?</h3>
					<p>The common response to a reported incident is an
						administrative action, a letter of reprimand or lost pay. In rare
						cases, offenders are court-martialed.</p>
					<p>Of those who received disciplinary action by command, only
						25% were court-martialed. About 5% of all investigations led to a
						court martial, 8% to non-judicial punishment and 7% to
						administrative disciplinary action or discharge instead of other
						punishment.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>How Is Military Sexual Trauma (MST) Different From Combat
						Trauma?</h3>
					<p>Service members often expect to face trauma in the line of
						duty; however, sexual assault or harassment is different. MST
						survivors who are a victim of someone within their own ranks often
						feel trapped as they live and work with, or rely on their
						perpetrators daily. Survivors may also face a disruption in their
						career goals. The attacker may have power or influence over the
						survivor&apos;s career advancement. Or survivors may choose to
						leave the military to escape their attackers. In the war zone,
						victims may rely on their attackers for medical and mental health
						care. This reliance on perpetrators can leave survivors feeling
						helpless, powerless, betrayed, angry, and alone. If you must rely
						on your attacker for any reason, you may feel disoriented or
						confused. MST survivors may also be at an increased risk of
						becoming a victim again.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Worrying About Compromising The Mission</h3>
					<p>If loyalty, teamwork, and mission success are highly valued,
						victims may hesitate to report the incident because they worry
						about the impact on the unit and mission. Survivors may also worry
						about their own reputations, appearing vulnerable in a military
						culture or others placing blame on them for what happened. MST
						survivors in the military say they were not believed, or were
						encouraged to stay quiet. Being &quot;hushed up&quot; can hinder
						their recovery and leave survivors feeling ignored and alone. The
						Department of Defense and the Armed Services are working to ensure
						that survivors are heard, believed, and treated with respect and
						understanding.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTS) and Military Sexual
						Trauma (MST)</h3>
					<p>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTS) includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Having unwanted, distressing memories or nightmares of
							the trauma.</li>
						<li>Avoiding reminders of the trauma, feeling emotionally
							numb and disconnected from others.</li>
						<li>Struggling with chronically high levels of tension and
							alertness.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Rates of lifetime post-traumatic stress are high among men
						and women who have been sexually assaulted. Research indicates
						that veterans who experience sexual trauma in the military develop
						post-traumatic stress at higher rates than those exposed to combat
						trauma, with 28.1% of female Veterans Affairs (VA) patients who
						reported a military sexual trauma and 18.4% of male patients
						having post-traumatic stress. This is due to the ongoing stress of
						living and working with the attacker, often in the same
						environment where they were attacked. Up to 60% of women who
						survived a military sexual trauma reported post-traumatic stress
						in one study. Research also shows that 65% of men who are raped
						develop post-traumatic stress.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Depression And Military Sexual Trauma (MST)</h3>
					<p>Sexual trauma survivors often say they feel sad,
						&quot;blue,&quot; or depressed. Many suffer loss of pleasure or
						joy, low energy and motivation, hopelessness and low self-esteem.
						It&apos;s normal to feel sad and upset after being assaulted or
						harassed. Depression interferes with the lives of many sexual
						trauma survivors, forcing them to seek professional treatment. One
						study of military sexual trauma survivors found nearly 46% of
						female and more than 28% of male survivors suffered from
						depression.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Anxiety And Military Sexual Trauma (MST)</h3>
					<p>Survivors may suffer from anxiety attacks. These attacks may
						come &quot;out of the blue&quot; or when the victim is reminded of
						the experience. Victims may constantly worry about possible
						dangers or difficulties and &quot;brace&quot; or prepare for and
						protect themselves from future attacks. It&apos;s important to
						know these are natural reactions for survivors to have when their
						sense of safety has been violated. If high anxiety is persistent
						you may want to consider seeking behavioral health care.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Emotional Numbness and Military Sexual Trauma (MST)</h3>
					<p>Many survivors of sexual trauma alternate between intense
						feelings and no feelings at all. Difficulty having feelings is
						also known as emotional numbness. Emotional numbness may mean you
						feel emotionally 'flat&apos;, or have difficulty experiencing
						happiness or love. In some instances survivors say they no longer
						know who they are, or what matters to them.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Problems With Alcohol Or Other Drugs After Military Sexual
						Trauma</h3>
					<p>Survivors often drink alcohol, use illegal drugs, or overuse
						prescription drugs to cope with intense feelings or sleep
						problems. One study found rape survivors were 3.4 times more
						likely to use marijuana, 6 times more likely to use cocaine, and
						10 times more likely to use other major drugs than people who had
						not been raped. Using drugs and alcohol to sleep or escape often
						backfires. Remember, sleep quality suffers when abusing alcohol or
						drugs and your &quot;medicated&quot; emotions and memories
						resurface when you sober up.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Sleep Problems And Military Sexual Trauma</h3>
					<p>The brains and bodies of survivors stay on alert and ready
						for danger after a traumatic experience and it&apos;s common to
						have trouble falling or staying asleep. Often survivors may avoid
						sleeping if they are experiencing disturbing nightmares or terrors
						that interrupt their sleep regularly.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Difficulties With Attention, Concentration, And Memory
						After a Military Sexual Trauma (MST)</h3>
					<p>Survivors may struggle with concentration, attention and
						memory, which may affect their work performance and strain
						relationships. Some survivors may not remember the event, or have
						vague or disjointed memories. Some may have &quot;checked
						out&quot; (present in body but not in spirit) during the
						experience. They may now feel detached or disconnected from their
						bodies or experience.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Shame And Self-Blame After Military Sexual Trauma (MST)</h3>
					<p>Survivors often feel shame or guilt over their trauma due to
						common misconceptions about sexual assault and harassment. Victims
						may blame themselves for what happened or regret decisions made
						before the trauma. They may feel humiliated or embarrassed over
						what they were forced or coerced to do. Victims place blame on
						themselves as a way to regain control over their lives. Remember,
						you should never take responsibility for your attacker&apos;s
						choices and behaviors.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Suicidal Thoughts After Military Sexual Trauma (MST)</h3>
					<p>Survivors may think about or attempt suicide to escape the
						fear, anger, depression and other intense feelings brought on
						after the MST. We strongly suggest that you reach out to others if
						you are thinking about suicide. If you need immediate crisis
						counseling, call the Veterans Crisis Line at 1-800-273-TALK.
						Counselors are available 24/7.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Difficulties In Relationships After Military Sexual Trauma</h3>
					<p>Relationships with loved ones, especially intimate
						relationships, can be deeply affected when one partner suffers a
						sexual trauma. Survivors may feel isolated or disconnected, and
						may have difficulty trusting others. This can lead to distance,
						fear, and difficulty with intimacy in relationships. Some
						survivors experience the double trauma of coming home to a violent
						or abusive relationship.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Difficulties At Work After Military Sexual Trauma (MST)</h3>
					<p>Some sexual trauma survivors have an increased need for
						control after feeling powerless during the attack. This can create
						struggles with Commanding Officers (or employers) over issues of
						authority, management and fairness in the workplace. Survivors
						have reported lower work satisfaction, especially in circumstances
						where the victim continues to work where the trauma took place and
						with their attacker(s). In some situations victims quit their jobs
						(including military careers) when they were unable to manage
						interactions with their attacker on a day-to-day basis, or when
						their work environments did not have an adequate support system in
						place.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Sexuality After Military Sexual Trauma (MST)</h3>
					<p>Sexual trauma affects one&apos;s sexuality and sex life.
						Medical issues may arise in the form of an STD or an unwanted
						pregnancy. Survivors may also see changes in their sexual
						responses (e.g., lack of desire, lack of orgasm, or painful
						intercourse). Sexual experiences may be interrupted by anxiety,
						fear, angry reactions, or unexpected memories of the incident.
						Intimacy may feel vulnerable and uncomfortable leading survivors
						to use alcohol or drugs to escape their sexual feelings. Some
						survivors practice risky sex or become highly sexual to regain a
						sense of control. Others may &quot;shut down&quot; physically and
						emotionally during sex after an assault. If you&apos;ve been
						sexually assaulted or harassed, it&apos;s important for you to
						focus on safety and comfort in your sexual experiences. Some
						survivors experience involuntary sexual arousal in response to
						sexual trauma. This involuntary response leads some survivors to
						wonder if they enjoyed the violation or are &quot;perverted.&quot;
						Some may question their sexuality or sexual orientation after the
						attack.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Physical Health Problems After Military Sexual Assault</h3>
					<p>During a sexual assault sexually transmitted diseases
						(STD&apos;s) or an unwanted pregnancy may be acquired. Sexual
						trauma is also linked to reproductive health problems, chronic
						back pain, pelvic pain, headaches, eating disorders,
						gastrointestinal problems, weight problems, and chronic fatigue.
						Survivors of MST are also more likely to drink and smoke and
						suffer from additional health problems (liver and lung disease).
						While female survivors suffer from weight and thyroid problems,
						male survivors are more susceptible to contracting HIV/AIDS.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Spiritual Crisis Following Sexual Trauma</h3>
					<p>Sexual trauma often leads to a spiritual crisis, especially
						for survivors who were spiritual or religious before they were
						assaulted or harassed. It is not rare for some survivors to think
						their trauma is a form of spiritual punishment. While some
						survivors gain a deeper faith due to their hardship, some become
						angry at God or life itself and lose their faith completely.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Men And Sexual Assault Or Harassment</h3>
					<p>While sexual assault is more common among women, men are
						also victimized by rape, harassment, and other forms of sexual
						assault. Either women or men can be the perpetrator. In the
						military, 23-28% of women, and 3.5% of men report being sexually
						assaulted. However, about the same number of people from each
						gender experience sexual assault, because men greatly outnumber
						women in the military.</p>
					<p>Male and female survivors react in similar ways to sexual
						trauma. However, men are often less willing to seek support. Many
						sexual assaults of men involve more than one attacker, weapons, or
						forced participation. Male survivors admit to feeling isolated,
						alienated from others, emotionally vulnerable, and insecure about
						their masculinity.</p>
					<p>Sexual assault for a man can lead to shame and self-doubt.
						It may also trigger negative self-judgments and cause male victims
						to question their masculinity. Men may feel confused if their
						bodies were sexually aroused involuntarily during the attack. This
						is often out of the victims control and in many cases the
						responses are muscular or involuntary. It&apos;s important to
						inform the victim that these reactions are not measures of
						pleasure or interest. Alternatively, in some cases, the assault
						may be somewhat pleasurable physically - but that does not mean
						the victim asked for, wanted, or consented to it.</p>
					<p>If you&apos;re a male survivor, you are not alone. Seeking
						help from loved ones or professionals can help you overcome your
						shame and isolation. Seeking help takes courage and strength, the
						courage to face what happened, and strength to admit and overcome
						your vulnerabilities. But with commitment, discipline, and the
						right support, you can recover from sexual trauma.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Women As Survivors Of Military Sexual Trauma (MST)</h3>
					<p>Women survivors of military sexual trauma face unique
						challenges as well. Rates of sexual assault and harassment are
						higher among service members than among civilians. This can
						potentially be linked to the reality that women are the minority
						in all the Services and in positions where they can be targets of
						violence.</p>
					<p>Female service member survivors may not be comfortable in
						the more traditional role of seeking help. They fear some may
						think they are just causing trouble or undermining the
						group&apos;s strength. Female survivors may also worry that
						speaking up will damage unity and morale, especially if their
						attacker is a co-worker or fellow service member. And because many
						women find it hard break into the military &quot;boys club,&quot;
						some worry coming forward will interfere with social and career
						opportunities or they won&apos;t be believed or taken seriously.
						However, by remaining silent, they are isolating themselves and
						may have a difficult time healing.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Who To Report Sexual Violation To</h3>
					<p>The United States Military has developed a system to provide
						support and resources to service members who have been sexually
						violated.</p>
					<p>To help military sexual trauma survivors, each branch has
						Sexual Assault Response Coordinators (SARC) to coordinate sexual
						assault victim care. SARCs are available 24/7 every day of the
						year. You don&apos;t need an appointment or referral to contact a
						SARC. If you have the number, call your local SARC. Or call
						Military OneSource to be connected to a SARC.</p>
					<p>If you want, the SARC will also assign you a Victim Advocate
						(VA). Victim Advocates provide support, liaison services and care.
						They provide crisis intervention, and they assist victims in
						receiving necessary services, referrals, and on-going non-clinical
						support. The VA provides information on available options and
						resources so you can make informed decisions about medical and
						mental health care and about reporting the assault. At your
						request, your VA can also go with you to investigative interviews,
						medical examinations and follow-up appointments. However, your VA
						does not make decisions or speak for you and won&apos;t interfere
						with the medical, investigative, or judicial processes.</p>
					<p>SARC&apos;s make sure you and other sexual assault victims
						get appropriate and responsive care and can help you determine if
						you should report your incident. They&apos;ll address any concerns
						you have about your health or well-being. And if you decide to
						report, the SARC will help you from the initial report through
						disposition of any legal case. Your SARC coordinator may ask some
						general questions about the incident to make sure you get medical
						and emotional help. All communication with the SARC is
						confidential and visits to the SARC will not affect your
						commissioning or PQ status.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>The Difference Between Unrestricted And Restricted
						Reporting</h3>
					<p>The military offers victims two different options for
						reporting an assault: Restricted and Unrestricted. These options
						address privacy concerns while making sure you receive medical
						care and counseling.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Unrestricted Reporting</p>
							<p>Unrestricted Reporting is a complete report of a sexual
								assault to military and legal authorities that activates
								victims&apos; services, including medical treatment and
								counseling. Unrestricted Reporting also notifies chain of
								command and triggers an official investigation. The Unrestricted
								Reporting process can be started by chain of command, law
								enforcement, a SARC, or even healthcare providers. When they
								receive a report of sexual assault, the SARC will immediately
								assign a Victims Advocate (VA). At the victim's request, a
								healthcare provider will conduct a Sexual Assault Forensic
								Examination (SAFE), which may involve collecting evidence.
								Access to details about the incident will be given only to those
								personnel with a legitimate need to know, such as the VA, chain
								of command, medical personnel, and law enforcement. Currently,
								military retirees, dependents, and other civilian victims may
								only use Unrestricted Reporting. In unrestricted reporting,
								victims are also assigned a Victim Witness Liaison (VWL). The
								VWL helps victims through the legal investigation process. The
								VWL will explain the victim&apos;s rights and keep the victim
								updated on the legal proceedings for the case. The VA works with
								the VWL to provide victims with information about where to get
								emergency medical care, social service support, and mental
								health treatment.</p></li>
						<li>
							<p>Restricted Reporting</p>
							<p>Restricted Reporting was created in 2005 to allow victims
								to confidentially disclose details of their assault without
								triggering an official investigation or notifying chain of
								command. Like the Unrestricted option, Restricted Reporting
								includes confidential medical treatment and counseling for the
								victim.</p>
							<p>If they choose the Restricted Reporting option, service
								members must report the assault to a SARC, a VA, a healthcare
								provider, or a chaplain. Generally, the assigned SARC, Victims
								Advocate (VA), and healthcare providers will not disclose
								confidential communications from a Restricted Report. But the
								SARC must report general information about the incident to
								command within 24 hours. If the victim reports the sexual
								assault to a healthcare provider, the provider will offer
								appropriate treatment, and report the assault to the SARC
								instead of law enforcement or command. When they receive a
								report of sexual assault, the SARC will assign a VA to the
								victim. At the victim&apos;s request, a healthcare provider will
								conduct a Sexual Assault Forensic Examination (SAFE), which may
								involve collecting evidence.</p>
							<p>Restricted reporting does have disadvantages. You cannot
								be protected from your attacker if the military is unaware you
								need protection. Only health care professionals, chaplains,
								SARCs, and VAs have a duty to maintain confidentiality. Others,
								including friends, may have to report the assault.</p></li>
					</ul>
					<p>*NOTE: Making a Restricted report does not prevent victims
						from later filing an Unrestricted report for the same incident.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Delayed Reports Of Sexual Assault</h3>
					<p>Reporting a sexual trauma immediately after the incident
						helps ensure all possible evidence is collected and preserved - in
						case you choose to pursue legal action. Timely reporting also
						provides the best chance to gather accurate testimony if there
						were any witnesses. But victims can report a sexual assault at any
						time and the investigation will be the same, no matter how much
						time has passed. Late reporting can impact other investigations
						involving the same attacker, and may help identify and prosecute a
						criminal. If you aren&apos;t sure whether to report an assault,
						you should discuss your concerns about reporting with a
						professional counselor. You can also speak to the Office of
						Special Investigations (OSI) or a legal representative to ask
						about investigative or legal processes.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Collateral Misconduct</h3>
					<p>Some victims worry about reporting sexual assault because
						they were involved in illegal conduct at the time of the assault,
						such as underage drinking or fraternization. This conduct may be
						considered collateral misconduct by the military. Collateral
						misconduct means that unit commanders have the option to delay
						disciplinary action for the misconduct until after the sexual
						assault case is resolved, although deferring discipline is not
						required. When choosing disciplinary actions for a victim's
						collateral misconduct, commanders and supervisors consider the
						impact on the victim. They will not choose disciplinary action
						that further traumatizes the victim or discourages others from
						reporting sexual assault. If you file a Restricted Report, beware
						that disciplinary action will not be deferred.</p>

					<h3>Legal Investigation Process</h3>
					<p>Investigations can be stressful for victims of sexual
						assault. The process from investigation to courts martial or other
						punishment can take months or years. During an investigation,
						victims may be asked difficult and personal questions. At least
						once a month, command should update victims on the investigation,
						until final disposition of the case. &quot;Final disposition&quot;
						means the conclusion of any judicial, non-judicial and
						administrative actions (including separation actions and &quot;no
						action&quot; decisions).

				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Work Transfers And Administrative Separation</h3>
					<p>Military sexual trauma survivors may choose to apply for
						work transfers or separate from the service as a result of their
						trauma. Another option to explore is &quot;no contact
						orders.&quot; Service members who live off post may also file for
						restraining orders from civilian courts. These decisions can be
						difficult, and some may interpret a transfer or separation as
						punishing the victim for reporting. Considering a transfer or
						separation may be the only way for a victim to stay safe and
						emotionally healthy.</p>

					<h3>Stages Of Recovery For Emotional Healing</h3>
					<p>Everyone reacts differently to sexual assault and
						harassment. The following are general stages of recovery that
						nearly all victims experience. These stages do not need to go in
						order. Recovery is not a linear process and survivors may pass
						through these stages at different times.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b><i>Initial shock.</i>
						</b> Immediately after the trauma, survivors may experience emotional
							and physical shock. This can be seen in the form of crying,
							screaming, shaking, or becoming very quiet and withdrawn.</li>
						<li><b><i>Denial.</i>
						</b> When in denial, survivors attempt to go back to their normal
							routine. They avoid thinking about the assault, or they deny its
							impact.</li>
						<li><b><i>Reactivation.</i>
						</b> During this stage survivors experience a reoccurrence of intense
							feelings (i.e., depression, anxiety, etc.) linked to the sexual
							trauma and will often reach out for help or counseling.</li>
						<li><b><i>Healing.</i>
						</b> Survivors begin to process their anger, grief, fear, and
							emotional turmoil in the healing stage. Survivors address the
							anger they feel toward themselves, friends, significant others,
							society, or the legal system. They are able to process their
							grief over the change that has occurred in their life since the
							trauma (i.e., loss of relationships, betrayed trust or lost
							innocence). It is in this stage that survivors begin to reclaim
							their lives.</li>
						<li><b><i>Integration.</i>
						</b> With support, hard work, and time, many survivors integrate the
							trauma into their larger life story. Survivors may view life with
							different priorities and their recovery can be a source of
							insight, political activism, and personal growth.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Final Tips To Work Toward A Positive Recovery</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><b><i>Create Safety:</i>
						</b> Secure a safe place to live, work and sleep..</li>
						<li><b><i>Self-Care:</i>
						</b> Manage any health concerns and seek support or counseling if you
							feel like hurting yourself or someone else. Avoid dangerous
							behaviors like alcohol abuse, drug use, unsafe sex and reckless
							driving.</li>
						<li><b><i>Get Support:</i>
						</b> Survivors tend to isolate themselves. Those who seek support from
							family, friends or a professional recover better than those who
							try to &quot;go it alone.&quot;</li>
						<li><b><i>Set Boundaries:</i>
						</b> Be firm, gracious and direct. When faced with resistance, repeat
							your statement of request.</li>
						<li><b><i>Develop Coping Skills:</i>
						</b> Everyone has different ways of coping with stress and upsetting
							events. Use relaxation tools, conflict resolution, and
							problem-solving to manage these life stresses as they arise.</li>
						<li><b><i>Revisit the Experience and its Effects:</i>
						</b> This process includes acknowledging the impact of the sexual
							violation, and expressing some of the feelings associated with
							it. For some, therapies like Prolonged Exposure Therapy and
							Cognitive Processing Therapy can ease intense feelings and fear
							and allow survivors to rethink their beliefs about the trauma.</li>
						<li><b><i>Reach Out and Help Others:</i>
						</b> Some survivors can reclaim a feeling of healthy power by
							advocating for themselves or other survivors or by doing
							something to support those in need.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Unhealthy Coping Methods</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><b><i>Emotional numbing:</i>
						</b> Can include avoiding feelings of anger, fear, happiness and love
							in order to avoid the emotional pain from the trauma.</li>
						<li><b><i>Dissociation:</i>
						</b> Is a way the body copes with an unbearable experience.
							Dissociation, meaning &quot;spacing out,&quot; &quot;checking
							out,&quot; or even losing memory for periods of time can become a
							habit-forming way to deal with stress or intense feelings.</li>
						<li><b><i>Obsessive-Compulsive behavior:</i>
						</b> Some survivors engage in obsessive unwanted and repeated
							thoughts, feelings, ideas, sensations (obsessions), or behaviors
							that make them feel driven to do something (compulsions). Often
							the person carries out the behaviors to get rid of the obsessive
							thoughts, but this only provides temporary relief. Instead, these
							obsessions and compulsions end up controlling the survivor.</li>
						<li><b><i>Alcohol/substance abuse:</i>
						</b> Some survivors turn to alcohol and drugs to escape from upsetting
							memories and emotions. However, these substances can hinder the
							recover process by creating health and relationship problems.</li>
						<li><b><i>Eating disorders:</i>
						</b> Survivors may try to gain control by binge-eating, purging
							(bulimia nervosa), or not eating at all (anorexia nervosa).
							Eating disorders can cause heart and kidney problems and even
							death. Getting help from a behavioral health counselor or
							nutritionist early is important.</li>

					<h3>Preventing Assault and Revictimization</h3>
					<p>Most sexual victimizations are committed by acquaintances.
						The following are general suggestions for reducing your risk of
						sexual assault.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Be assertive and communicate your limits clearly. For
							example, be direct about reaching an understanding with a friend
							or date. Sex without consent is rape, whether the coercion used
							is physical or emotional.</li>
						<li>Remember that alcohol and drugs impair not only your
							judgment but also your ability to make that judgment clear to
							someone else. If you are socializing with a group or friends that
							are using alcohol or drugs, their judgment, and the ability to
							understand you, will also be impaired.</li>
						<li>Be prepared. Consider enrolling in a self defense class
							where you will learn techniques on how to maintain awareness of
							your surroundings, how to use objects to defend yourself and how
							to attack the most vulnerable points of a body.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>When Should I Consider Seeking Help From a Behavioral
						Health Counselor?</h3>

						feelings that interfere with your ability to function. Consider
						seeking outside help if you experience:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Alcohol or substance abuse</li>
						<li>Extremely vivid memories of the event, like it&apos;s
							happening again</li>
