					<h3>Tobacco Use in the Military</h3>
					<p>In the 1980's, more than half of service members smoked
						(51%). While that number declined by 2005 (32%), the overall
						percentage was still above the national rate of smoking among
						adults. And nearly 30% of Veteran Affairs (VA) patients smoke.
						Service members also use other tobacco products, including chewing
						tobacco and snuff. These smokeless tobacco products are just as
						addictive as cigarettes.</p>

					<h3>Why Should I Quit Smoking?</h3>
					People start smoking, and continue to smoke, and even quit smoking,
					for many different reasons. Whatever led to the decision to quit,
					quitting has major benefits.
					<ul>
						<li><i>Health problems:</i> smoking-related illnesses such as
							heart and lung disease and cancer take a toll on physical
							readiness and quality of life.</li>
						<li><i>Work-related problems:</i> smokers are more likely to
							miss work, have poorer motor and perceptual skills, and less
							endurance.</li>
						<li><i>Financial problems:</i> the Department of Defense
							spends an estimated $875 million annually on smoking-related
							health care and financial losses due to work absences and
							decreased productivity. Veterans Affairs (VA) estimates that
							health care costs for smoking-related problems will be as much as
							$2 billion per year within the next decade.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>What Is The Best Way To Quit?</h3>
					While nicotine addiction can be hard to break, success is improved
					with preparation.
					<ul>
						<li>Get yourself 'psyched up'</li>
						<li>Set a date to quit</li>
						<li>Talk to your doctor</li>
						<li>Tell family, friends, coworkers</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

					<h3>How Are Tobacco Use and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
						(PTSD) Related?</h3>
					<p>The rate of smoking among service members with PTSD doubles
						that of civilians. Service members and veterans with PTSD also
						smoke more heavily than service members and veterans who do not
						have a PTSD diagnosis. Many service members with PTSD claim that
						smoking reduces their stress. But, while smoking may cause a
						short-term decrease in anxiety, research shows that nicotine can
						make PTSD symptoms worse. In fact, nicotine stresses the nervous
						system just like a life threatening situation: there is an
						increase in heart rate, blood pressure, and adrenaline, and parts
						of the body no longer get adequate blood supply.</p>

					<h3>Will I Go Through Withdrawal When I Quit?</h3>
					<p>Nicotine is the addictive chemical in cigarettes and other
						tobacco products. "Withdrawal" can occur when a substance that the
						body has become dependent on, such as nicotine, is discontinued.
						Almost all people who quit nicotine will experience some kind of
						withdrawal symptoms. The longer a person has smoked or has used
						smokeless tobacco, the more severe the withdrawal symptoms may be.
						Withdrawal symptoms tend to be strongest the first week after
						quitting; as a result, this is the period when many people start
						using tobacco again. Common withdrawal symptoms including feeling
						hungry, having difficulty sleeping, and feeling frustrated or mad.
						Most phsyical symptoms (hunger, sleep difficulty) disappear after
						a couple of weeks. Emotional dependence can last longer.</p>

					<h3>How Do I Handle Cravings?</h3>
					<p>Almost everyone has cravings soon after they have quit using
						tobacco. Because individuals learn to associate life experiences
						with tobacco use, cravings come to be triggered by people, places,
						objects, situations, times of day, and feelings. Breaking the
						"vicious cycle" between triggers and the act of smoking involves
						stopping the craving dead in its tracks. Do the following:
					<ul>
						<li><i>Identify</i> triggers by paying attention to different
							experiences that trigger the urge to use.</li>
						<li><i>Avoid</i> these triggers. For example, avoid places
							such as bars where other people are using.</li>
						<li><i>Deal</i> with triggers without smoking or using
							tobacco. Keep your mouth and hands busy by chewing gum or hard
							candy, or by calling a friend.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>What If I Smoke Or Use Tobacco After I Quit?</h3>
					<p>Setbacks usually occur within the first three months of
						quitting. If you have a setback, accept that you've gotten off
						track, avoid being too hard on yourself, and get back on track!
						And while it's common to have a few setbacks, it's best to not use
						'every now and then,' no matter how long it's been since you quit.
						Even though occasional use may seem harmless, occasional use can
						lead to more frequent use.</p>

					<h3>Where Can I Find Support To Help Me Quit?</h3>
					<p>People who have social support who are engaged in accessing
						resources are 50% more likely to quit than those who lack support.
						To help you quit, try the following resources:</p>
					<ul>

							facilites have smoking cessation programs for service members and
