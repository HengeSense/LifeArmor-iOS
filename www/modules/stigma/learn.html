					<h3>What Is Stigma?</h3>
					<p>Stigma is rejection, discrimination, or any other mode of
						separating people based on their characteristics. An individual or
						group is stigmatized if they are seen as different or
						&quot;worse-off&quot; than their peers. Individuals can stigmatize
						themselves as well. For example, if you believe that you are
						&quot;weak&quot; and &quot;incompetent&quot; because you
						can&apos;t solve a problem like depression or PTSD on your own,
						you are self-labeling and could stigmatize yourself.</p>
					Stigma has four parts:
					<ol>
						<li><b>Labeling</b> someone with a condition (e.g., saying
							someone is &quot;depressed&quot;).</li>
						<li><b>Stereotyping</b> people with that condition (e.g.,
							thinking that every depressed person is &quot;weak&quot;).</li>
						<li><b>Creating a division</b> between &quot;us&quot; and a
							devalued &quot;them&quot; group (e.g., thinking &quot;unlike us,
							depressed people make lousy soldiers&quot;).</li>
						<li><b>Discriminating</b> against someone on the basis of
							their label (e.g., excluding a depressed colleague from after
							duty activities).</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>Military Myths and Stigma</h3>
					There are many myths about mental and physical injuries and the
					treatment process for these problems. These myths can create
					stigma. You may have heard any of these myths expressed as facts by
					commanding officers, other service members, family, friends, or
					even by yourself. These myths are not facts. They are labels and
					they can lead to stigma. Understanding that these &quot;facts&quot;
					are really myths with no basis in truth can help you avoid
					labeling, and stigmatizing, yourself and others. Some common myths
					are:
					<ul>
						<li>&quot;Everyone who goes to war gets PTSD.&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;Commanders and respected service members don&apos;t
							struggle with post-deployment issues.&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;Real warriors can harden themselves to perform with
							little to no sleep.&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;People who seek professional help dishonor their
							families.&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;Anyone who has seen a mental health professional is
							unfit for duty.&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;Anything you say in therapy or to your chaplain can
							be shared with your command.&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;Courage in combat requires the absence of
							fear.&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;People with brain injuries never get better.&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;Only women get sexually assaulted.&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;Thinking about suicide or having thoughts of death
							means a person will commit suicide.&quot;</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

					<h3>Fear of Stigma</h3>
					<p>Service members and their families can fear being
						stigmatized. This fear keeps many service members from talking to
						friends and family or seeking treatment. For families, the fear of
						stigma comes in two ways. Families may resist seeking help for
						problems at home because they don&apos;t want to cast doubt on the
						service member&apos;s fitness for duty. Family members may also
						fear stigmatizing themselves by admitting their family needs help,
						e.g., &quot;my husband needs counseling because I&apos;m not a
						supportive wife.&quot;</p>
					<p>Fear of stigma can cause families to keep post-deployment
						issues secret from everyone, including each other. Maintaining the
						&quot;secret&quot; of their returning service member&apos;s
						difficulties can damage relationships within the family, among
						friends, and even at work. Instead of asking for help, service
						members with post-deployment challenges may give up on personal
						goals that now seem out of reach. Friends, family, colleagues, and
						even service members themselves can become disappointed and angry
						with the changes. Even with the best efforts to mask problems,
						work can suffer and struggling service members can be &quot;found
						out&quot; by command or colleagues.</p>
					<p>When fear of stigma interferes with seeking help, it can
						cause serious problems. Studies show that recent service members
						who have returned from deployment are at an increased risk for
						suicide. Many deaths could be avoided if service members felt
						comfortable asking for help.</p>

					<h3>Using Realistic Thinking to Get Over Stigma</h3>
					<p>
						In a combat environment, you were taught to think through
						worst-case-scenarios. In unpredictable and dangerous situations
						this is a critical survival skill. In the non-combat environment,
						thinking of worst-case scenarios actually makes more trouble than
						it prevents. Remember, the worst case is only one possible
						outcome. You can choose to focus on the <i>probable</i> instead of
						the possible and avoid trapping yourself in believing that the
						worst case is the most likely case.
					</p>
					Realistic thinking takes into consideration what is <i>probably</i>
					going to happen instead of focusing on the best- or worst-case
					scenario. Realistic thinking has two parts when it comes to
					receiving help:
					<ol>
						<li>Think about whether you have changed in a way that is
							causing problems for you or the people around you. Deployment
							changes everyone in positive and negative ways because it is such
							an intense and unique experience. Many of the effects of
							deployment will reduce naturally over time. However, if you are
							having trouble readjusting, or if the people around you notice
							negative changes in you, try identifying exactly what has changed
							and how much of a problem the change is causing.</li>
						<li>Think through what will <i>probably</i> happen if you go
							for help -- <span class="underlined_text">not</span> what might
							possibly happen. Make a list of pros and cons to help you
							identify the probable and possible outcomes for getting help.
							Notice there are many more likely possibilities than the
							worst-case scenario.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>Overcome Stigma by Getting Input from Someone You Know and
						Respect</h3>
					<p>One of the best ways to overcome stigma is to get input from
						someone you know and respect who has received counseling. You can
						ask about their experiences, how they decided to get help, and any
						positive or negative effects that had on their home and work. If
						you don&apos;t know anyone who has gone for counseling, challenge
						yourself to speak with at least one person you trust. They may be
						able to assist with weighing out the pros and cons of seeking
						professional care.</p>
					Here are some tips for talking with others about post-deployment
					challenges:
					<ul>
						<li><b><i>Be prepared.</i>
						</b> Know what you want to say and how you are likely to feel so you
							will not be caught off-guard and end up saying more or less than
							you intended.</li>
						<li><b><i>Tell them what you need from them.</i>
						</b> Do you want them to just listen, help you make a decision about
							seeking help, provide another viewpoint, or let you know if your
							view of a situation is right?</li>
						<li><b><i>Test the waters.</i>
						</b> Say a little and see how they do with it. This will also give you
							the opportunity to see how you do with the telling.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Help Others to Combat Stigma</h3>
					<p>If people know someone they respect who has sought help,
						they are more likely to not feel stigma about their
						post-deployment issues and getting help if needed. So, if you have
						seen a counselor or health care professional, take a risk and let
						other people know. You may feel uncertain about this, but your
						bravery can help others to make challenging decisions about their
						health and well-being.</p>
					<p>Even if you have never received treatment, you can be open
						and supportive in giving your fellow service members an
						opportunity to talk. Be a comrade: look for signs that others are
						struggling and do what you can to help them overcome their
						post-deployment challenges. Stigma can be isolating, so don&apos;t
						assume that someone else has already told them to seek help. You
						may be the only person who actually makes the effort to support
						them.</p>

					<h3>Are There Consequences for Seeking Help in the Military?</h3>
					<p>
						While many service members worry that their security clearance
						will be revoked if they see a behavioral health professional, the
						truth is that less than one percent of those investigated for
						clearances are rejected solely on the basis of their mental health
						profiles. In fact, in May 2008, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates
						announced that the Department of Defense had revised &quot;the
						infamous question 21&quot; on its security clearance
						questionnaire. Now, people who seek help for combat-related issues
						or who receive marital counseling <i>don&apos;t</i> have to answer
						&quot;yes&quot; when asked if they have ever &quot;consulted with
						a health care professional regarding an emotional or mental health
						condition.&quot;
					</p>
					<p>
						Being aware of stigma and rejecting myths about treatment helps
						you be in control of the decision to seek help. A recent study
						showed that of the service members who <i>self-referred</i> for
						mental health treatment, only three percent had a negative career
						impact. In comparison, 39 percent of service members who were
						referred by their commanders had a negative career impact. Colonel
						Scott Marrs, Ph.D., Chief of the Air Force&apos;s mental health
						division said: &quot;Seeking mental health care doesn&apos;t harm
						your career. It&apos;s not being able to do your job because of
						personal issues that can harm your career.&quot;
					</p>

					<h3>Getting Help for Deployment-Related Problems</h3>
					Help is available to you. You have bravely served and sacrificed
					for your country and it is your right to receive care and support.
					It is in your best interest, and the interest of your family,
					friends, and mission for you to get the help you need. A safe and
					effective force is strong and mentally healthy. There is courage in
					asking for help, strength in learning to manage struggles, and
					pride in moving on from challenges. To find help near you, use the
					support finder button in the tools section of this app.
