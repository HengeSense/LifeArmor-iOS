					<h3>Drinking In The Military</h3>
					<p>Heavy alcohol consumption is a significant problem in the
						military, affecting both uniformed service members and their
						families. Excessive alcohol use, either in the form of heavy
						drinking (drinking more than two drinks per day on average for men
						or more than one drink per day on average for women), or binge
						drinking (drinking 5 or more drinks during a single occasion for
						men or 4 or more drinks during a single occasion for women) can
						lead to an increased risk of numerous alcohol-related problems,
						including accidents, cancer and liver cirrhosis, as well as work,
						financial and social problems.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Drug Use In The Military</h3>
					<p>There has been a steep rise in the misuse of illegal and
						prescription drugs in the military. Prescription drugs account for
						the second most commonly abused category of drugs, behind
						marijuana. Prescription drug abuse is the use of a prescription
						medication in a way not intended by the prescribing healthcare
						provider. Misusing drugs can have severe consequences including a
						dishonorable discharge or jail time.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Prescription Drug Use In The Military</h3>
					<p>The prescription drugs most often prescribed to service
						members include painkillers or sedatives for anxiety and sleep
						disorders. Some service members abuse these prescription pain
						medications to cope or numb themselves from stress or painful
						feelings. Abusing drugs can lead to depression and addiction and
						in some instances if mixed with other drugs or alcohol can also
						lead to an overdose or death. Identifying prescription drug abuse
						early can help fix the problem before it becomes more serious or
						turns into an addiction.</p>
					<i>Signs of prescription drug abuse include:</i>
					<ul>
						<li>Stealing, forging or selling prescriptions</li>
						<li>Taking higher doses than prescribed</li>
						<li>Continually &quot;losing&quot; prescriptions, so more
							prescriptions must be written</li>
						<li>Seeking prescriptions from more than one doctor</li>
						<li>Excessive mood swings</li>
						<li>Appearing to be high, unusually energetic or revved up,
							or sedated</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>How Do You Know When There Is a Problem?</h3>
					If you think you may have a drug or alcohol problem, ask yourself:
					<ul>
						<li>Have you found that you were not able to stop drinking
							once you started?</li>
						<li>Have you failed to do what was normally expected from you
							because of drinking?</li>
						<li>Have you had a feeling of guilt or remorse after drinking
							or using drugs?</li>
						<li>Do you need to have a first drink in the morning to get
							yourself going after a heavy drinking session?</li>
						<li>Have you been unable to remember what happened the night
							before because you had been drinking?</li>
						<li>Has a relative or friend been concerned about your
							drinking or suggested you cut down?</li>
						<li>Have you been drinking more or using more drugs over
							time?</li>
						<li>Have you tried unsuccessfully to cut down on alcohol or
							drugs?</li>
						<li>Do you use alcohol or drugs in situations that are
							dangerous (i.e., driving or operating machinery)?</li>
						<li>Do you drink or use drugs when you&apos;re alone, angry,
							sad or bored?</li>
						<li>Do you use when reminded of upsetting deployment
							memories?</li>
						<li>Do you ever use after telling yourself you won&apos;t?</li>
					</ul>

					If you answered "yes" to one or more of these questions you may
					want to consider decreasing your consumption with help from
					friends, family, and community groups (i.e., Alcoholics Anonymous
					or Narcotics Anonymous) or seek help from a professional.

					<h3>Substance Misuse And Post-Traumatic Stress</h3>
					Service members may use alcohol or drugs as a way to relieve
					post-traumatic stress, depression, irritability or upsetting
					memories. However, self-medicating with alcohol and/or drugs only
					provides temporary relief and can pose additional challenges,
					including:
					<ul>
						<li>Increased anger and irritability</li>
						<li>Nervousness and paranoia</li>
						<li>Reduced productivity at work</li>
						<li>Increased risk for suicide, accidents or acts of violence</li>
						<li>Conflicts with family members and friends</li>
						<li>Difficulty concentrating, coping with trauma memories, or
							sleeping</li>
						<li>Problems dealing with life stress</li>
						<li>Feeling emotionally &quot;numb&quot;</li>
						<li>Not wanting to be around people</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Sleep Problems And Substance Abuse</h3>
					Service members often find they have more nightmares or sleep
					terrors after a stressful or traumatic deployment. Traumatic means
					a life-threatening or terrifying event that produces intense fear,
					helplessness, or horror. These types of reactions are often
					associated with post-traumatic stress. To cope with nightmares and
					sleep terrors, some people use alcohol or drugs, or even avoid
					sleeping. Unfortunately, these methods not only worsen the sleep
					problem, they often lead to new problems.
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Making Healthy Choices With Alcohol</h3>
					It is important to know how much drinking is too much, or "when to
					say when." For most adults, consuming a moderate amount of alcohol
					is not harmful and will not lead to alcohol-related problems.
					Moderate alcohol use means:
					<ul>
						<li>Up to two drinks per day for men</li>
						<li>Up to one drink per day for women</li>
						<li>Up to one drink per day for older adults</li>
					</ul>
					One drink means:
					<ul>
						<li>A 12-ounce bottle of beer</li>
						<li>A 5-ounce glass of wine</li>
						<li>1.5 ounces of 80 proof distilled liquor</li>
					</ul>
					NOTE: Moderate alcohol use is <span class="underlined_text">not</span>
					safe for everyone. Abstain from drinking alcohol if:
					<ul>
						<li>You&apos;re pregnant</li>
						<li>You have any health condition that could be affected by
							alcohol</li>
						<li>You take medications that can interact with alcohol</li>
						<li>You&apos;re a recovering alcoholic</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Putting Moderate Drinking Into Action</h3>
					To keep your drinking within moderate levels, you can try the
					following.
					<ul>
						<li>Make a plan:</li>
						<li>Decide ahead of time how many drinks you will have.</li>
						<li>Decide how you&apos;ll get home safely.</li>
						<li>Commit to going home at a certain time.</li>
						<li>Think of reasons to drink moderately (or not at all)
							before you go out, for example: &quot;I want to wake up
							early&quot; or &quot;No thanks, I have the car keys.&quot;</li>
						<li>Bring enough money for only a couple drinks and leave
							your credit cards at home.</li>
						<li>Remember to eat before you drink. Having food in your
							body will affect how quickly or slowly alcohol enters your
							bloodstream.</li>
						<li>Be fashionably late to the party or bar in order to limit
							your drinking time.</li>
						<li>Order non-alcoholic drinks (water) between alcoholic
							drinks.</li>
						<li>Know your limit. A good rule of thumb is one drink per
							hour.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Cut Back On Alcohol Without Giving It Up</h3>
					Maybe it&apos;s time to speak honestly to yourself and cut back on
					your drinking. The tips here are designed for the social drinker
					who wants to cut back but doesn&apos;t need to stop drinking
					altogether. If you need more help, please see a health care
					provider.
					<ul>
						<li>Other than special occasions, limit your drinking to the
							level associated with optimal health. (Up to two drinks per day
							for men, one for women - and no stockpiling! Going without
							alcohol today doesn&apos;t increase the amount you can have
							tomorrow.)</li>
						<li>Meet friends, dates, or business associates at a coffee
							bar, not a tavern.</li>
						<li>Avoid drinking alone. If you learn to drink alone it
							makes it too easy to drink in excessive amounts. In addition, try
							limiting the amount of alcohol you keep at home.</li>
						<li>Write down the reasons (family, social, legal, work,
							etc.) you are limiting your drinking (or drug use) on a piece of
							paper and and place it in your wallet to remind yourself daily.</li>
						<li>Pick one or more days of the week to not drink at all.</li>
						<li>Practice ways to say &quot;no&quot; when offered an
							alcoholic drink, for example &quot;thank you but I&apos;m
							planning on waking up early tomorrow morning to train for an
							upcoming race (or athletic event).&quot; Say it quickly and
							firmly so that you don&apos;t give yourself time to change your
							mind.</li>
						<li>Pace yourself by sipping your drink slowly and make sure
							you have no more than one drink an hour.</li>
						<li>Take up a hobby, begin an exercise program, make new
							friends, or spend quality time with your family. Find something
							that you enjoy that will occupy the time during which you would
							usually be drinking.</li>
						<li>Be assertive - don't be pressured into drinking.</li>
						<li>Get help from family, friends, a healthcare provider,
							church member, or a self-help group like Alcoholics Anonymous
							(AA).</li>
					</ul>
					<b><i>Don't give up.</i>
					</b> It may take several attempts to make healthy changes to your
					substance use habits.

					<h3>Getting Home Safely</h3>
					The following are tips on how to get home safely after drinking.
					<ul>
						<li>Designate a driver or plan ahead and order a taxi before
							departing the house.</li>
						<li>Stow cash and taxi numbers in your wallet or purse.</li>
						<li>Choose to take public transportation and research the
							operating schedules and fares before leaving the house.</li>
						<li>If you walk home, make sure to use the buddy system (walk
							with someone) and stay in well-lit areas. Don't wander off alone,
							especially if you are drunk.</li>
						<li>Get a hotel room or stay at a friend's house.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Abstinence: When Safe Use is No Use</h3>
					Seriously consider quitting the use of drugs or alcohol altogether
					if:
					<ol>
						<li>The substance you use controls you.</li>
						<li>You have chronic problems in relationships such as:
							<ol id="ol_letters">
								<li>Exposing loved ones to violence or harm</li>
								<li>Avoiding or distancing yourself emotionally from family</li>
							</ol></li>
						<li>Hurting family finances by spending too much money on
							alcohol or drugs. Some service members are motivated to quit when
							family members confront them about their drinking or drug use. If
							you use illegal drugs, STOP! You are risking your health,
							military career, relationships, and your legal record.</li>
					</ol>

					<h3>Getting Help For Both Substance Use And Combat
						Stress/Post-Traumatic Stress (PTS)</h3>
					Find a professional who works with substance abuse problems and
					PTS. Many VA hospitals offer support and treatment. Contact your
					local VA hospital or Vet Center for information about programs that
					work with substance use and combat stress problems. Your
					post-traumatic stress reactions may get worse when you initially
					quit drinking or using. Keep in mind that substance abuse can cause
					sleep and relationship problems, which make PTS worse. While
					challenging at first, working on both issues at the same time is
					more effective than working on them separately.
