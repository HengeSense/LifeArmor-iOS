			<p>
				Go back over the last few minutes or hours and <em>Identify</em>
				what reminder of your trauma you encountered. Triggers can be inside
				ourselves, like thoughts or memories, or outside of ourselves, like
				conversations or situations or things we encounter in the world
				(e.g., a particular person or place). Figuring out what triggered
				you can be tricky sometimes. Do not worry if you cannot identify the
				trigger, just focus on relaxing and talking yourself down.
			</p>
			<p>Once you identify the trigger, it is important to notice how
				it is just a reminder and not the actual trauma happening again,
				despite how your mind and body may be reacting. Really notice how
				the current trigger is different from your trauma. Remind yourself
				of those differences again and again.</p>
