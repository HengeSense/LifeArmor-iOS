					<h3>Challenges in Returning to Work after Deployment</h3>
					<p>Deployments interrupt your normal work life. Some
						deployments involve intense mission focus and the threat of
						combat. Other deployments can feel disorienting with too much time
						after duty and none of the usual after work responsibilities of
						home. Some deployments cycle from boredom to combat to boredom and
						force you to drastically adjust your mind-set without warning.
						When you return from deployment, you may need to change your
						expectations and behavior to adjust back to &quot;normal&quot;
						work. Some common difficulties in transitioning back into the
						workplace include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Feeling the job is pointless or boring.</b> Returning
							service members sometimes report that work seems pointless or
							dull compared to their deployment missions. Service members who
							endured difficult deployments may feel anxious, irritable, or on
							edge. Co-workers or supervisors may not share the same sense of
							urgency about daily tasks. These feelings can lead to a negative
							outlook toward the workplace and co-workers.</li>
						<li><b>Feeling on edge in crowded, busy work
								environments.</b> During deployments, survival sometimes depends on
							thinking, feeling, and acting automatically. However, these same
							automatic responses, which may have saved your life in the
							war-zone, can be counterproductive back in the workplace. Many
							worksites are busy places with many people coming, going, and
							moving around. If you are uneasy in crowds, you may find being at
							work exhausting and stressful. Constantly feeling on high alert
							may also result in being easily startled.</li>
						<li><b>Low self-esteem at work.</b> Some service members
							return home feeling depressed or guilty about things that
							happened during deployment. People who judge themselves
							negatively often suffer from low self-esteem. This can cause
							trouble concentrating and completing tasks. Low self-esteem can
							also make you feel that you&apos;re not worth your boss or
							coworkers investing time or energy in and may make you want to
							quit before trying to find solutions.</li>
						<li><b>Trusting your coworkers and supervisor.</b> You may
							find that you don&apos;t trust people who have no deployment or
							military experience. Some service members admit they don&apos;t
							really trust anyone. At work, trust problems make accomplishing
							tasks through teamwork more difficult.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>The Importance of Returning to Work</h3>
					<p>Work can greatly impact the kind of success a returning
						service member experiences. Successful workplace reintegration can
						result in:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Greater self-esteem and sense of well-being.</li>
						<li>A sense of purpose and contribution.</li>
						<li>Improved mood through work achievements.</li>
						<li>Stability and routine that lets you feel safe to plan for
							the future.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Difficult workplace reintegration can result in:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Feelings of isolation and failure.</li>
						<li>Increased stress, frustration, and worry.</li>
						<li>Difficulties with memory and focus.</li>
						<li>Problems in relationships with job peers or supervisors.</li>
						<li>Difficulty sleeping or waking.</li>
						<li>Anger or irritability.</li>
						<li>Low self-esteem.</li>
						<li>Problems with drugs or alcohol.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Strategies to Successfully Reintegrate to Work</h3>
					<p>There are things you can do to improve your return to the
						workplace. Many of these strategies can also help your
						post-deployment reintegration with your family and friends. These
						strategies include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Maintaining your physical health.</li>
						<li>Talking about your deployment and its impact on you.</li>
						<li>Asking for support.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Maintaining Your Physical Health</h3>
					<p>Like a car, your body is vulnerable to problems when not
						maintained properly. Physical health problems can affect your
						moods, concentration, sleep, relationships, and job performance.
						If you&apos;re having trouble staying physically healthy:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Stick to a sleep routine.</li>
						<li>Exercise daily.</li>
						<li>Take timeout to relax or do enjoyable activities.</li>
						<li>Take medications as prescribed.</li>
						<li>See a doctor for illnesses or injuries when necessary.</li>
						<li>Eat healthy foods regularly throughout the day.</li>
						<li>If you drink, do so in moderation.</li>
						<li>Try to quit smoking or using other tobacco products.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Talking About Your Deployment</h3>
					<p>Discussing deployment experiences is your decision. You
						don&apos;t have to reveal anything you don&apos;t want to. Know
						that people will be curious about your experiences and may ask you
						about them. Coworkers may ask difficult questions about your
						deployment. Identify the things that will upset you, and be ready
						to cope with them. Remember that strong anger or intimidation by
						either person in the conversation is not appropriate at work. Even
						if you&apos;re provoked, you don&apos;t have to behave in a way
						that gets you reprimanded or dismissed.</p>
					<p>If you don&apos;t want to talk about your deployment or get
						asked questions that provoke or upset you, it can be useful to
						have a few prepared responses, such as:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>&quot;No offense, but I don&apos;t like to talk about my
							war experiences.&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;I&apos;m not comfortable answering those questions
							right now.&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;Let&apos;s talk about something else.&quot;</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

					<h3>Asking for Support</h3>
					<p>Your ability to ease into the workplace rests in part on
						your willingness to communicate your struggles. If you are having
						difficulty readjusting to work, it may be helpful to discuss this
						with your coworkers or supervisor. Stress not only impacts your
						work performance, but may be affecting your coworkers too. If you
						work in the civilian sector, your coworkers and supervisor may not
						know how to respond to deployment-related issues and they may
						appear uncomfortable. Most of the time, it&apos;s simply a lack of
						understanding of the military, war, and combat-related stress.</p>
					<p>Tips for asking for support:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Talk with a trusted counselor, family member, or friend
							FIRST. The two of you can weigh the pros and cons of sharing
							concerns with your supervisor or coworkers.</li>
						<li>Focus. What needs to be said? Focus on problems that
							affect the workplace, and the steps you will take to manage those
							problems.</li>
						<li>Consider possible reactions. Will they understand? Will
							they listen? If you think they won&apos;t support you, then be
							prepared for that, too.</li>
						<li>Carefully choose who to talk to. Maybe just your direct
							supervisor needs to know. No matter who it is, make sure you have
							good reasons to share with them.</li>
						<li>Focus On Work Success. Emphasize the importance of
							succeeding at work, and doing the things that will support work
							performance. Tell them the conversation will explain the
							workplace problems you&apos;re having and how they can support
							you.</li>
						<li>Remember that people want to know about your deployment
							experiences. You may get some uncomfortable questions, but its
							best to assume that people mean well with their questions.</li>
						<li>Don&apos;t assume confidentiality. Consider the potential
							risks if something you discuss privately is revealed to
							unintended parties.</li>
						<li>Keep in mind that a lot of people outside the military
							don&apos;t know much about war, trauma, depression, deployment,
							or the military. Be patient when discussing your personal
							experiences.</li>
						<li>Try a brief conversation and check the reaction. You
							don&apos;t have to share everything at once.</li>
						<li>Stay Positive. Explain things in a positive way. This
							puts everyone at ease and reassures them</li>
