			<h1>Assertiveness</h1>
			<p>Description: The goal of this tool is to help you learn to
				feel more control over situations in your life. Changing the words
				we use to think and speak about ourselves is a key way to feel more
				powerful.</p>
			<p>The way we feel about ourselves is affected by the way we
				speak. Sometimes we use language that makes us feel out of control
				and powerless. When events seem to go against our wishes, it's
				important to use language that helps us feel powerful. One method is
				to see our interactions with others as a series of invitations. We
				can either accept or decline these invitations. When you view events
				as a series of invitations you will begin to feel more control over
				your life.</p>
			<p>Here is how it sounds when you use the language of invitation:
