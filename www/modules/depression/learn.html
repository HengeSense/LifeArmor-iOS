					<h3>Depression</h3>
					Depression is a medical illness that affects emotions, thoughts,
					and behavior. Also called major depression, major depressive
					disorder, and clinical depression, depression is the most common
					mental disorder. Fortunately, depression is treatable!
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Symptoms of Depression</h3>
					Depression can change or distort the way you see yourself, your
					life, and those around you. People who have depression usually see
					everything with a more negative attitude, unable to imagine that
					any problem or situation can be solved in a positive way. Symptoms
					of depression can include:
					<ul>
						<li>Headaches, stomach problems, chronic pains that
							don&apos;t improve with treatment.</li>
						<li>Thoughts of death or suicide.</li>
						<li>Memory problems.
						<li>Poor judgment.</li>
						<li>Racing thoughts.</li>
						<li>Always feeling sad, anxious, or &quot;empty&quot;.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If you&apos;re depressed, you may experience several
						symptoms at the same time. For example, you may feel tired, have
						trouble sleeping, and no appetite. Symptoms of depression often
						last longer than two weeks. Severe symptoms can get in the way of
						social, work, and family duties. If you think you&apos;re
						depressed, it&apos;s best to seek in-person help from a primary
						care physician or behavioral health professional.</p>
				</div>

					<h3>Depression, Thoughts, and Behavior</h3>
					<p>Moods, thoughts, and behaviors are interconnected. In fact,
						negative thoughts can lead you to not do activities that might
						make them feel better. This leads to more negative thinking,
						resulting in the 'downward spiral&apos; of depression. The
						'negative action, negative mood&apos; scenario that typifies
						depression and which can cause a person to feel &quot;down&quot;,
						tired, sad, or hopeless might also involve the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Avoiding tasks that require energy or effort.</li>
						<li>Putting off important tasks until you feel better.</li>
						<li>Avoiding family or friends.</li>
						<li>Sleeping a lot or haveing trouble sleeping.</li>
						<li>Misusing alcohol and other substances.</li>
						<li>Overeating, or not eating well.</li>
						<li>Watching TV or playing video games alone.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Automatic Thoughts</h3>
					<p>&quot;Automatic&quot; thoughts occur without an obvious,
						&quot;conscious&quot; recognition of their occurrence. Automatic
						thoughts often reflect what&apos;s happening around you or how you
						feel about yourself. Automatic negative thoughts can contribute to
						depression. Much of what we think and believe is the result of
						what we&apos;ve learned from parents, friends, the media, and
						society. In fact, some forms of depression are known as learned
						thinking problems. Since thoughts are &quot;learned,&quot; they
						can be &quot;unlearned&quot; by learning how to think positively.
					</p>
					<p>You can pull yourself out of a downward spiral. The key to
						finding your way out is to move toward what&apos;s important. For
						example, even if you don&apos;t feel motivated, do things that are
						in line with your values or that set realistic and achievable
						goals.</p>

					<h3>Depression and Suicide</h3>
					The expression of suicidal thoughts should always be taken
					seriously. While depression carries a high risk of suicide,
					individuals with suicidal thoughts may not show signs of depression
					before attempting suicide. <b><i>Do not hesitate to call
							your local suicide hotline immediately at 1-800-273-8255. <a
							href="http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org" target="_blank">
								www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org</a> if you or someone you know is
							experiencing suicidal thoughts.</i>
					</b> Suicide hotlines are free and confidential and offer support
					services, treatment, and suicide prevention.

					<h3>Grief and Depression.</h3>
					While we all experience grief and loss, each of us is unique in the
					ways that we cope with our feelings. If at some point your grief
					encompasses your life and you begin to feel hopeless, helpless, and
					worthless, it is best to consult with a healthcare professional.
					Your grieving may have become more reflective of an actual
					depression. Consider the following:
					<ul>
						<li>Give yourself permission to grieve - grief is normal and
							natural.</li>
						<li>Grieving takes time. Be patient.</li>
						<li>Spend time with people who have suffered a similar loss.
							Join a support group and share your story with others.</li>
						<li>Find helpful people, such as family or friends, a
							chaplain or other spiritual advisor.</li>
						<li>If the grief doesn&apos;t go away, seek professional help
							from a psychologist, social worker, or other healthcare
							professional.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Though it may be difficult to ask for help, healthcare
						professionals offer a safe place to talk about depression. If you
						need help, here are some resources to consider:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Make an appointment with your primary care provider
							(PCP).</li>
						<li>Contact a trained health result consultant through the
							Defense Centers of Excellence (DCoE) Outreach Center. HRC&apos;s
							provide guidance about depression and other behavioral health
							problems 24/7. Call 1-866-966-1020.</li>
