					<h3>What Is Anger?</h3>
					<p>Anger is an emotion characterized by antagonism toward
						someone or something you feel has deliberately done you wrong.
						Anger can be a good thing. It can give you a way to express
						negative feelings, for example, or motivate you to find solutions
						to problems. Alternatively, excessive anger can cause problems.
						Increased blood pressure and other physical changes associated
						with anger make it difficult to think straight and can harm your
						physical and mental health.</p>

					<h3>When Does Anger Become A Problem?</h3>
					<p>Anger is a completely normal, usually healthy, human
						emotion. When your anger gets out of control and turns
						destructive, it can lead to problems, problems at work, in your
						personal relationships, and in the overall quality of your life.
						Anger can make you feel as though you&apos;re at the mercy of an
						unpredictable and powerful emotion. When your anger becomes too
						intense or leads to violent behavior your heart rate and blood
						pressure go up, as do the levels of your energy hormones,
						adrenaline and noradrenalin. Additional health concerns can
						include: high cholesterol, muscle and joint pain, heart disease,
						chronic pain and even early death.</p>
				</div>

					<h3>What Is The Difference Between Being Aggressive and Being
						Assertive?</h3>
					<p>The instinctive, natural way to express anger is to respond
						aggressively. Aggression is a behavior and can mean acting in a
						forceful, dominating way and can include physical violence or
						verbal threats. Being aggressive can have temporary benefits to
						include: quickly met demands from people who fear your physical
						and verbal threats, the release of built up physical emotion and
						the feeling of respect from others when they give in to you
						aggressive demands.</p>

					<p>Assertiveness is also a type of behavior but is a mode of
						communication that affirms a person&apos;s point of view without
						threatening the rights of another. Expressing your angry feelings
						in an assertive, not aggressive, manner is the healthiest way to
						express anger. Being assertive doesn&apos;t mean being pushy or
						demanding; it means being respectful of yourself and others.</p>

					<h3>How Do I Prevent My Anger From Becoming Aggressive Or
						Violent?</h3>
					<p>You can manage your anger by familiarizing yourself with the
						three phases of the &quot;Aggression Cycle&quot; in addition to
						using a 0-10 &quot;Anger Meter&quot; scale. Using this anger meter
						scale will offer you a way to rate the intensity of your anger.
						The three phases of the Aggression Cycle are as follows:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>The Escalation Phase:</b> During the escalation phase,
							anger is building. Any anger meter scores rated below a "10"
							means you are currently in this phase.</li>
						<li><b>The Explosion Phase:</b> During the explosion phase
							you have reached a &quot;10&quot; on the anger meter and may
							express your emotions with verbal or physical aggression. This
							may include cursing, breaking or hitting things and fighting.</li>
						<li><b>The Post-Explosion Phase:</b> The post-explosion phase
							is the result of the explosion phase and you may experience
							feelings of guilt, shame, and regret after hurting friends,
							coworkers or significant others and you now be faced with further
							struggles at work or legal problems.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>How Can I Control My Anger?</h3>
					<p>Anger&apos;s physical cues can range from an increase in
						heart rate, feeling hot or flushed to muscle tension. It&apos;s
						physically impossible to be both angry and relaxed at the same
						time. When you recognize these anger cues in yourself try
						practicing a deep breathing exercise like Breathe2Relax which is a
						mobile application that can be downloaded to your smartphone or
						slowly repeat a calm word or phrase such as &quot;take it
						easy&quot;. Practice these techniques daily and learn to use them
						automatically when you&apos;re in a tense situation.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>What Can I Do Before &quot;It's Too Late&quot;?</h3>
					<p>When you get angry, challenge any negative thoughts
						contributing toward that anger or try saying the following phrases
						to yourself:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>&quot;I&apos;m going to stop thinking these thoughts
							because they make me feel worse.&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;I&apos;m just going to take it easy.&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;I&apos;m going to take a deep breath and count to
							10.&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;I know that getting angry won&apos;t solve this
							problem.&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;I&apos;m going to let it go.&quot;</li>
					</ul>
