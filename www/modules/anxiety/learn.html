					<h3>Anxiety and Worry: The Basics</h3>
					<p>Anxiety is a mix of thoughts, emotions, and physical
						reactions. People describe experiencing &quot;butterflies&quot; or
						&quot;knots&quot; in their bellies, or a pounding heart, or chest
						tightness. Anxiety can be useful, signaling the body to go
						&quot;on alert&quot; and prepare for action. Worry is the thinking
						part of anxiety in which the worrier regularly predicts the
						occurrence of negative or catastrophic events in his life or in
						the life of loved ones. Worried thinking often leads to anxiety's
						physical symptoms (rapid heartbeat, restlessness, disrupted sleep,
						etc.)</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>When Does Anxiety Become A Problem?</h3>
					<p>Anxious feelings may be so uncomfortable that an individual
						will do anything to avoid the feelings, including stopping or
						changing every day activities. Anxiety becomes an &quot;anxiety
						disorder&quot; when it regularly interferes with common daily
						activities. For example, severe anxiety can prevent a person from
						going to work or from engaging in meaningful events with friends
						and family.</p>
					<p>
						The body will also react to anxiety that lacks an <span
							class="underlined_text">actual</span> &quot;cause.&quot; For
						example, during a panic attack, there may be physical symptoms
						such as dizziness, blurred vision, numbness, tingling, stiff
						muscles, and breathlessness, possibly all in response to an
						imagined threat. Even though there is no <span
							class="underlined_text">actual</span> threat, the body's
						reactions are <span class="underlined_text">interpreted</span> as
						life-threatening even though they are not dangerous. This is
						called <i>catastrophic thinking</i>. An individual with
						catastrophic thinking can get caught up in a vicious cycle:
						physical symptoms lead to anxiety, and anxiety 'feeds' back into
						the physical symptoms, worsening the intensity of those symptoms.
						This has the net effect of increasing the tendency to make
						catastrophic predictions.

					<h3>What Are Common Types of Anxiety Disorders?</h3>
					Here are some types of anxiety disorders:
					<ul>
						<li><i>Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)</i> is defined as
							worrying constantly about small or large concerns. GAD is usually
							accompanied by physical symptoms such as restlessness, fatigue,
							irritabilty, and trouble sleeping.</li>
						<li>Panic Disorder is characterized by recurrent panic
							attacks which involve sudden feelings of fear and terror for no
							obvious reason. Panic attacks can happen without warning and are
							usually accompanied by physical symptoms such as difficulty
							breathing, rapid heartbeat, dizziness, and chest pain.</li>
						<li><i>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)</i> develops
							following the experience of a trauma in which severe physical
							harm occurred or was threatened. Individuals may have persistent
							frightening thoughts of the trauma, feel emotionally dampened or
							numb, or easily startled.</li>
						<li><i>Social Anxiety Disorder</i> is characterized by marked
							anxiety in social situations due to excessive fear of being
							criticized or scrutinized by others.</li>
						<li><i>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is
								characterized by recurrent, unwanted, and intrusive thoughts
								(obsessions) and or repetitive behaviors (compulsions).
								Intrusive thoughts may be of a specific danger or an unrealistic
								fear of harming oneself or others.</i>
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>What Causes Anxiety Problems?</h3>
					Anxiety is associated with a family history of the disorder, brain
					chemistry, and the occurrence of traumatic events.
					<ul>
						<li><i>Family History Genetics</i>. Often, anxiety disorders
							are hereditary. If parents or other close relatives have had
							problems with anxiety, children are more likely to develop an
							anxiety disorder.</li>
						<li><i>Learning</i>. Children learn how to behave by
							observing others. Parents who are worriers and who regularly
							predict negative outcomes increase the probability that their
							children will learn this style of thinking and develop anxious
							behaviors.</li>
						<li><i>Brain Chemistry</i>. Thoughts and feelings are
							regulated by chemical messengers in the brain, called
							neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters that are out of balance can
							increase anxiety symptoms.</li>
						<li><i>Traumatic Events</i>. A traumatic event, such as
							witnessing a death, or being in combat, can lead to anxiety.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>

					<h3>What Makes Anxiety Worse?</h3>
					Recognizing that life circumstances can worsen anxiety is an
					important first step toward reducing anxiety. Here are some
					situations that can worsen anxiety.
					<ul>
						<li><i>Stress</i>. Stress affects everyone, but overwhelming
							stress can result in anxiety, especially for people who are
							vulnerable or actively diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.</li>
						<li><i>Caffeine</i>. Stimulants, such as caffeine found in
							coffee, tea, soda, chocolate, and some over-the-counter
							medications, can aggravate anxiety.</li>
						<li><i>Unrealistic Thinking</i>. Anxiety often affects an
							individual's ability to think clearly and discriminate between
							rational and irrational thoughts.</li>
						<li><i>Poor Coping Skills</i>. Anxiety is unlikely to resolve
							or improve when effective coping skills are absent.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Do Individuals With Anxiety Experience Other Problems?</h3>
					Yes, in fact, anxiety is often accompanied by other conditions,
					such as:
					<ul>
						<li><i>Alcohol Abuse</i>. Many people who feel anxious use
							alcohol to calm themselves, especially in social situations.
							However, alcohol can worsen anxiety and panic.</li>
						<li><i>Depression</i>. Approximately half of individuals
							diagnosed with depression also present with anxiety.</li>
						<li><i>Eating Disorders</i>. Some people who experience
							anxiety eat, and potentially overeat, to calm themselves.</li>
						<li><i>Medical Conditions</i>. Anxiety symptoms such as
							racing thoughts or a rapid heartbeat can interfere with sleep.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>How Can I Manage My Anxiety?</h3>
					There are many strategies that can help with worry and anxiety.
					Muscle relaxation, imagery, and breathing exercises calm the mind
					and reduce the physical symptoms of anxiety. Other strategies are
					designed to teach worriers to change catastrophic thinking oso that
					imagining &quot;worse case&quot; scenarios and predictions of
					disaster are reduced. Here are some helpful treatments:
					<ul>
						<li>Psychotherapy</li>
						<li>Medication</li>
						<li>Progressive Muscle Relaxation</li>
						<li>Guided Imagery Visualization</li>
						<li>Diaphragmatic Breathing</li>
						<li>Distraction</li>
					</ul>
