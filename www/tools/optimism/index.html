				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>Optimism means we take a positive perspective on life and
					expect that good things will happen in the future. Being optimistic
					is key to coping with life problems.</p>
			</div>
			<p>It is possible to learn to change the lens through which you
				view the world. There are six key steps to maintaining a perspective
				of realistic optimism:</p>

			<p>Step 1: Make sure you view the world as it really is. Don't
				think about what could happen, but pay attention to what is actually
				going on around you.</p>

			<p>Step 2: Focus on things that are positive. In the Army's
				Resilience program this is called &quot;hunt for the good
				stuff.&quot; Even if life isn't perfect, it's important to focus on
				the things that work out well.</p>

			<p>Step 3: Resist the urge to complain. It usually makes you feel
				worse. Complaining will push away the positive people in your life
				and attract people who further encourage frustration and negativity.</p>

			<p>Step 4: Decide for yourself what's possible and what's
				impossible. Question any beliefs you have that something &quot;can't
				be done.&quot; There are many things we dismiss too easily.</p>

			<p>Step 5: Be FOR things, not against them. When you are against
				something you are focused on tearing it down. When you are FOR
				something you are focused on improving it, and creating new ideas
				and new opportunities.</p>

			<p>Step 6: Laugh at yourself. See the humor in your mistakes.
				Humor helps us take our guard down and not take ourselves too
				seriously. We all make mistakes, most mistakes are an opportunity to
				learn and grow. Think back to something you thought was absolutely
				true ten years ago, but you now realize was false. Can you laugh at
				it now? Laughing at ourselves is an important tool to improve our
				mood, change our perspective, and relieve stress.</p>
