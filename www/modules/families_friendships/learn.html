					<h3>Adjusting To Being Home</h3>
					<p>Now that you&apos;re at home, you may feel and act
						differently than you did before deployments. Your family and
						friends may have changed too. This is normal, but you may find it
						hard to reconnect with loved ones and wonder if things will ever
						get back to &quot;normal.&quot; Below is a list of common
						post-deployment issues. Can you relate to any of them?</p>
					<ul>
						<li>I&apos;m less interested in activities I used to enjoy.
						<li>I&apos;m having a hard time trusting others.</li>
						<li>I need to be in control of my emotions all the time.</li>
						<li>I don&apos;t want to talk about what happened in the war
							zone.</li>
						<li>I&apos;m having a hard time with face-to-face
							communications.</li>
						<li>I have less interest in sexual activity.</li>
						<li>I&apos;m confused about my role at home.</li>
						<li>I&apos;m having a hard time talking with my kids.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Overcoming Isolation</h3>
					<p>After a deployment, you may think you have little in common
						with friends and family, or that they can&apos;t understand you.
						You might keep to yourself to try and avoid situations that bring
						up painful feelings or memories. Connecting with others can help
						you improve your mood, deal with painful thoughts and feelings,
						avoid harmful coping methods (like heavy drinking), and realize
						you are not alone. To overcome isolation, try doing things with
						people where your attention is on the activity instead of the
						person. Volunteering, playing a game or sport, working on a
						project, or taking a community center class are all ways you can
						be around people without feeling like all the attention is on you.
						You may have to push yourself to spend time with others. Be
						intentional. Make a plan to socialize and stick to it even when
						you&apos;d rather be alone.</p>

					<h3>Talking About Deployment</h3>
					<p>Some service members just want to put their deployment
						experiences behind them. However, not talking about it can
						increase upsetting thoughts and make you feel isolated. Talking
						about your experiences can be difficult but can also ease their
						impact. Consider speaking with close friends, family members,
						chaplains, counselors, or therapists who can provide support. Wait
						to talk about your deployment until you are well-rested, feeling
						calm, and have enough time to share your thoughts and get
						feedback.</p>
					<p>Some things you might want to consider sharing are:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The actual events of your deployment.</li>
						<li>Thoughts and feelings you have about those events.</li>
						<li>Ways you&apos;ve coped with your experiences.</li>
						<li>Ways you&apos;ve grown or changed since your deployment.
						</li>
						<li>Ways you found strength you didn't know you had.</li>
						<li>Things you&apos;ve learned that might help others to cope
							with similar experiences.</li>
						<li>Practical decisions, such as what to do about your job
							now.</li>
						<li>Thoughts about your future.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>If you worry about getting emotional when talking about
						deployment, remember these tips:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>It&apos;s ok to get emotional. Once you share, your
							emotions won&apos;t seem as overwhelming.</li>
						<li>Tell the person you may get emotional, and you&apos;d
							appreciate their support if you do.</li>
						<li>Take a chance. Talk about painful feelings or thoughts
							even if it&apos;s hard.</li>
						<li>Expect some uncomfortable feelings after talking about
							hard issues. Know that these feeling are easier to handle with
							time and practice.</li>
						<li>Inform the other person you may need to take a break to
							calm down or collect yourself.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Here are suggestions for talking about your deployment
						without going into too much detail:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>&quot;I saw and did some really intense things that are
							hard for me to talk about. Thanks for your patience.&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;Sometimes my memories make me space out and I have
							a hard time concentrating.&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;I&apos;m on edge a lot since my deployment. Please
							try not to take it personally.&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;I might need a few minutes to calm down. Thanks for
							giving me some space.&quot;</li>
					</ul>
					<p>After talking about your deployment, Thank the person for
						listening. They should know you value their time and support. Take
						some time to cool-down or do something fun and easy to help shift
						back to the present.</p>

					<h3>Handling Conflict</h3>
					<p>Arguing can make it hard to talk to your partner about
						deployments. It&apos;s important to discuss problems in a way that
						builds up the relationship instead of tearing it down. Here are
						some ideas for handling conflicts with family members:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b><i>Plan ahead.</i>
						</b> Schedule time to discuss the problem. This gives both of you time
							to think about what you would like to say. Find a time and place
							you can talk without distractions.</li>
						<li><b><i>Identify your goal.</i>
						</b> If your goal is to "win" the argument, your relationship will
							suffer. Seek an outcome that will satisfy you both. This usually
							requires compromises from both partners.</li>
						<li><b><i>Use "I" Statements.</i>
						</b> When you bring up an issue, don&apos;t blame the other person.
							Blame makes people defensive. Instead, use &quot;I&quot;
							statements, telling the other person how you feel. For example,
							instead of saying, "you never listen to me," say "I feel
							frustrated when you read the newspaper while I&apos;m
							talking.&quot;</li>
						<li><b><i>Stick to one topic.</i>
						</b> Bring up a specific issue that happened. Tell the other person
							exactly what happened and why it bothered you. Focus on resolving
							the issue, instead of bringing up other things. Avoid saying
							"always&quot; or &quot;never.&quot;</li>
						<li><b><i>Stay calm.</i>
						</b> When you get upset, you're less likely to think clearly, and
							you're more likely to say things that don't help the situation.
							Remain calm by taking breaks, breathing deeply and slowly, or
							taking a brief walk to relieve tension. Be sure to tell your
							partner if you need a short break from the conversation so it
							doesn't seem like you're walking away.
						<li><b><i>Avoid:</i>
						</b>
							<ul>
								<li>&quot;Below-the-belt shots&quot; like shouting,
									name-calling, foul language, threats, and sarcasm.</li>
								<li>Criticizing and lashing out in anger during arguments.</li>
								<li>Trying to control a conversation by demanding that
									others respond in a certain way.</li>
								<li>Expecting others to solve problems for you. You need to
									help find the solution.</li>
							</ul></li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Supporting Your Family</h3>
					<p>Your family may need extra support from you. They may be
						worried or upset about what happened to you or they may feel like
						they don&apos;t know you anymore. You can support your family by:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Reminding them how much you care about them.</li>
						<li>Listening to them with an open mind, even when you have a
							different opinion.</li>
						<li>Acknowledging their feelings: &quot;I know that this is
							hard for you, too.&quot;</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Reconnecting with Family and Friends</h3>
					<p>A great way to reconnect with your family is to find out
						what happened while you were gone. Try these tips for reconnecting
						with family and friends:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Go to a sporting event, concert or a movie together.</li>
						<li>Take a walk, hike, or a bike ride together.</li>
						<li>Talk about your experience living in a different country.</li>
						<li>Make a scrapbook or photo album of your lives together.
							Include your deployment as one chapter in a larger story.</li>
						<li>Ask what they did while you were gone.</li>
						<li>&quot;What movies did you see while I was away?&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;What music have you been listening to lately?&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;Anything interesting happen recently at
							work/school?&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;What funny things have the kids done lately?&quot;</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Paying attention to the positives helps you feel better and
						helps your loved ones feel appreciated.</p>
