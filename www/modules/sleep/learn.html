					<h3>Sleep Basics</h3>
					<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Our bodies naturally want to be awake during the day and
							to sleep at night &mdash; this natural tendency is referred to as
							the &quot;circadian rhythm&quot;.</li>
						<li>The circadian rhythm is hard to change, and explains why
							adjusting to a late-night work schedule can be difficult.</li>
						<li>Sleep is a complex activity and occurs in five stages,
							each progressively involving a deeper level of rest.</li>
						<li>It is during the fifth stage, the &quot;Rapid Eye
							Movement&quot; or REM stage, that most dreaming occurs.</li>
						<li>Good sleep is vital to a healthy lifestyle, helping
							people manage stress and solve problems.</li>
						<li>Good sleep has been found to accelerate recovery from
							illness and injury.</li>
						<li>Lack of sleep can lead to drowsiness, irritability, lack
							of concentration, and memory and physical problems.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>How Much Sleep Do I Need?</h3>
					<p>While the amount of sleep needed for good health and optimum
						performance mostly depends on the individual, experts suggest that
						adults function best when they get seven to nine hours of sleep
						each night. Ensuring that fatigue isn't a problem during the day
						is one way of determining how much sleep is needed.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Why Am I Not Sleeping?</h3>
					<p>From time-to-time, most people encounter occasions during
						which they are not getting enough sleep. Sleep problems can be
						caused by stress, pain, drugs, alcohol, diet, lack of exercise, or
						an irregular sleep schedule, or irregular shift work. People who
						are not sleeping well are more likely to be depressed, irritable,
						or anxious. Poor sleep can also lead to problems with attention,
						concentration, and memory. Chronic sleep problems can hurt
						relationships, job performance, and increase the risk of
						accidents.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>What is Insomnia?</h3>
					<p>Insomnia involves one or more of the following symptoms:
					<ul>
						<li>More than thirty minutes to fall asleep</li>
						<li>Once asleep, difficulty staying asleep</li>
						<li>Waking up several times through the night</li>
						<li>Waking up early then having difficulty getting back to
							sleep</li>
						<li>Feeling tired or not well rested</li>
						<li>Difficulty focusing on tasks</li>
						<li>Feeling anxious, depressed, or irritable</li>
						<li>Performing poorly at work due to fatigue</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Are Anxiety, Depression, and Insomnia Related?</h3>
					<p>On the positive side, when confronting potentially dangerous
						situations, anxiety can prompt alertness and cautiousness.
						However, while anxiety is a normal reaction to stress, persistent
						anxiety can lead to sleep problems. Fortunately, as stress
						diminishes, so does anxiety.</p>
					<p>Sleep problems can be caused by a depressed mood. Depression
						can cause changes in body temperature. Individuals with depression
						often sleep lightly and feel less rested when they wake up. There
						can also be changes in the amount of dreaming that they do.</p>
					<p>
						Where depression or anxiety is causing or worsening a sleep
						problem, treating the mood problem often helps with the sleep
						problem, too. In turn, sleeping better helps improve mood
						problems. A healthcare professional can help you determine if
						you're having a mood problem. You can also practice relaxation
						techniques and healthy sleep habits suggested on <a

					<h3>What is Sleep Apnea?</h3>
					<p>Sleep apnea is a condition during which a person stops
						breathing for several seconds to minutes. The throat briefly
						closes, blocking air from the lungs. People with sleep apnea may
						wake up often during the night gasping for breath. Sleep
						interruptions can cause exhaustion and irritability. In severe
						cases, sleep apnea can be deadly.</p>
					<p>You may have sleep apnea, if you:
					<ul>
						<li>Snore loudly</li>
						<li>Are overweight</li>
						<li>Have high blood pressure</li>
						<li>Have small airways in your nose, throat, or mouth</li>
						<li>Have a family history of sleep apnea</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p>If you have sleep apnea, avoiding alcohol, tobacco, and
						drugs, losing weight, and sleeping on your side (instead of on
						your back) may be helpful. However, sleep apnea is a serious
						health problem and should be evaluated by a health care provider.

					<h3>What is Narcolepsy?</h3>
					<p>Narcolepsy is a medical disorder. Individuals with
						narcolepsy have trouble staying awake or fall asleep suddenly and
						without warning. This condition can occur while driving, working,
						eating, and even during dangerous activities. While some people
						have specific triggers that bring on the condition, the triggers
						can be difficult to identify.</p>
					<p>Risk factors include certain thyroid disorders, diabetes, a
						family history of narcolepsy, and having an autoimmune disorder.</p>
					<p>
						Although there is no cure, narcolepsy requires medical
						intervention. Lifestyle changes can also help control the problem,
						including routine compliance with prescription medications, taking
						naps, and practicing good sleep hygiene like the tips taught on <a
							href="http://afterdeployment.org/web/guest/topics-sleep"
							target="_blank">afterdeployment.org.</a>

					<h3>What is Restless Leg Syndrome?</h3>
					<p>People with Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) have crawling,
						tingling, or burning sensations in their legs or arms. RLS
						sensations make it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep. People
						with RLS may also suffer from Periodic Limb Movement disorder
						which causes a jerking movement of the legs and arms. These
						movements happen roughly every 20-40 seconds, waking the person.</p>
					<p>
						If you think you have RLS, consult with a health care provider.
						You can also make some lifestyle changes, such as avoiding
						alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, and certain medications that make the
						condition worse, exercising regularly, massaging your arms and
						legs before bed, using heat or ice packs on your arms and legs,
						and practicing good sleep hygiene, like the tips taught on <a
							href="http://afterdeployment.org/web/guest/topics-sleep"
							target="_blank">afterdeployment.org.</a>

					<h3>Is My Sleep Problem All In My Head?</h3>
					<p>Sleep problems can have many causes, from genetics to diet
						to stress. While no one has control over all of the possible
						causes, it is important to work on the things that can be
						controlled. One of those areas is learning to control negative
						thoughts about sleeping.</p>
					<p>Because your body reacts to frustration, negative thoughts
						at bedtime can set off a negative cycle that leads to insomnia.
						Your heart may race, your muscles may tense, and your head may
						start to ache. Your discomfort makes you worry, which makes you
						restless. Falling asleep becomes harder and may feel impossible.</p>

					<h3>Why Am I Having Nightmares?</h3>
					<p>Occasional nightmares are normal. Usually, nightmares tend
						to be about stressful or traumatic events. Service members often
						find they have more nightmares after a stressful or traumatic
						deployment. Traumatic means a life-threatening or terrifying event
						that produces intense fear, helplessness, or horror. These types
						of reactions are often associated with Post-Traumatic Stress
						Disorder.</p>
					<p>
						To cope with nightmares and sleep terrors, some people use alcohol
						or drugs, or even avoid sleeping. Unfortunately, these methods not
						only worsen the sleep problem, they often lead to new problems.
						There are many suggestions for managing nightmares on <a
							href="http://afterdeployment.org/web/guest/topics-sleep"
							target="_blank">afterdeployment.org.</a>
					</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Are Nightmares and Sleep Terrors the Same Thing?</h3>
					<p>Nightmares and sleep terrors are not the same thing. During
						a nightmare, the traumatic event is &quot;relived.&quot; The same
						fear, rage, or helplessness that was felt during the actual event
						may be re-experienced.</p>
					<p>Most people don't remember sleep terrors when they wake up.
						Any sleep terror memories are single images &mdash; not a story
						like in a nightmare. Sleep terrors can be so frightening or
						terrifying that they produce screaming, shaking, sweating, a
						racing heart, confusion, and difficulty calming down. When the
						sleep terror ends, the individual can calm down and return to
						normal sleep.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>How Can I Get Regular/Good Sleep?</h3>
					<p>Sleep behavior and sleep habits have a large impact on the
						ability to achieve regular and restful sleep. Sleep habits can be
						harmful but also healthy. At night, the body and the mind should
						be prepared for sleep. Here are some things to do at least one
						hour before bedtime to help with relaxing and avoiding harmful
						sleep habits.
					<ul>
						<li>Listen to soft music or engage in light reading.</li>
						<li>Take a warm bath or shower.</li>
						<li>Avoid things that are physically or mentally demanding,
							like working, studying, playing video games, or watching violent
							movies or television shows.</li>
						<li>Keep your bedroom peaceful and comfortable.</li>
						<li>Dim the lights and keep it quiet; darkness and quiet tell
							the body it's time to sleep.</li>
						<li>Keep a comfortable bedroom temperature (not too cold, not
							too hot).</li>
						<li>Follow the same relaxing sleep ritual every night.</li>
					</ul>
					</p>

					<h3>If I Can't Fall Asleep, Shouldn't I Just Stay In Bed Until
						I Do?</h3>
					<p>It's not good to stay in bed if you can't fall or stay
						asleep. Lying awake in bed teaches the body that the bed is a
						place to stay awake, rather than a place to sleep. If you can't
						sleep, don't stay in bed longer than thirty minutes. Go to another
						room and do something quiet and relaxing. Return to bed when you
						feel drowsy.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Should I Try To Catch Up When I've Lost Sleep?</h3>
					<p>Unfortunately, it's impossible to &quot;catch up&quot; on
						lost sleep. Sleeping in late or going to bed early may cause your
						body to learn a new, harmful sleep pattern. Don't allow yourself
						to stay in bed for more than an hour longer than you would get
						with a normal night's sleep. If you want to overcome sleep
						problems, set a sleep schedule and stick to it.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>What About Nicotine? Can Smoking Or Chewing Impact Sleep?</h3>
					<p>Because nicotine is a stimulant, it can actually interfere
						with sleep. Don't smoke, chew or dip tobacco near bedtime.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Won't Alcohol Help Me To Sleep?</h3>
					<p>It's best to avoid alcohol at night. While alcohol can make
						falling asleep easier, this effect only lasts a few hours. As
						alcohol starts to wear off, it's actually harder to stay asleep or
						sleep restfully.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Is There Anything I Should Be Doing When I Wake In The
						Mornings?</h3>
					<p>Morning is the time for both the body and the mind to wake
						up. In the morning, light filtering in to the bedroom should be
						increased. Bright light tells the brain it's time to wake up!
						Research shows that it's best to wake up at the same time every
						day, even on weekends.</p>
