					<h3>What Is Spirituality?</h3>
					<p>Spirituality has been defined in numerous ways. These can
						include a belief in a higher power operating the universe that is
						greater than onself, a sense of interconnectedness with all living
						creatures, or an awarenss of the purpose and meaning of life and
						the development of personal values. Spirituality is also about a
						connection with a divine presence, within or outside of any
						religious affiliation. Some of the ways people describe
						spirituality include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Life&apos;s meaning and importance.</li>
						<li>Values, beliefs, and ethics.</li>
						<li>Awareness of life beyond yourself.</li>
						<li>Connection between you, others, and God;</li>
						<li>Reflecting on life, and a sense of &quot;deep self&quot;
							or soul.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>What Is Spiritual Fitness?</h3>
					<p>Spiritual fitness means having a set of beliefs and values
						that guide and give life meaning. Spiritual practices tend to
						improve coping skills and social support, foster feelings of
						optimism and hope, promote healthy behavior, reduce feelings of
						depression and anxiety, and encourage a sense of relaxation. By
						alleviating stressful feelings and promoting healing ones,
						spirituality can positively influence immune, cardiovascular,
						hormonal and nervous systems. Studies have also found that
						veterans who have an active spiritual practice report fewer and
						less severe PTSD symptoms. Spiritual fitness can also bond people
						through love, forgiveness, and compassion.</p>
					<p>Like physical fitness, spiritual fitness must be tended to
						and practiced. Some people stay spiritually fit by participating
						in organized religion. Others stay spiritually fit by spending
						time in nature, volunteering, creating something useful, or
						playing with a pet.</p>
					<p>People who struggle in their spirituality or relationship
						with God may struggle in other areas of their life as well.</p>

					<h3>War and Spirituality</h3>
					<p>Many service members think about spiritual issues during and
						after deployment. It&apos;s normal to look at the world
						differently after facing danger and death. Some gain a stronger
						relationship with God. Others may question their beliefs or feel
						spiritually empty. You may wonder:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>&quot;Was that death God&apos;s will?&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;Is there any meaning or purpose to the awful things
							I saw or experienced?&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;Am I condemned, or a bad person, because of my
							actions?&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;Can I be forgiven?&quot;</li>
						<li>How can I trust anyone after what I know people are
							capable of?&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;Why did this happen to me? What did I do to deserve
							this?&quot;</li>
						<li>&quot;Why did my buddy die and not me? It should&apos;ve
							been me.&quot;</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Spiritual Alienation and Isolation</h3>
					<p>Spiritual alienation means moving away from what is
						spiritually meaningful, sacred, or divine. Reactions to trauma,
						such as questioning the meaning of events, doubting your beliefs,
						and feeling betrayed by God or life itself, can lead to feeling
						spiritually alone and alienated. Feeling disconnected or isolated
						from others often goes hand in hand with spiritual alienation.</p>
					<p>Feeling alone and disconnected is common after a traumatic
						event. You may feel like no one understands what you&apos;ve been
						through. After being injured or seeing others hurt or killed, you
						may feel angry or vulnerable and have problems trusting people.
						You may want to withdraw or isolate yourself, but without at least
						a little trust in something or someone, life can get lonely and
						bitter.</p>
					<p>You may feel even more disconnected and alone if you think
						&quot;all-or-nothing&quot; thoughts that put things in black and
						white terms. Remember that there is usually some gray area.
						Instead of thinking &quot;The world is never safe&quot; or &quot;I
						can&apos;t trust anyone,&quot; try thinking &quot;Something bad
						happened, but that doesn&apos;t mean the whole world is
						unsafe&quot; or &quot;I can&apos;t trust everyone, but I can trust
						some people with some things.&quot; Remind yourself that there are
						people you can trust and connect with them. Connecting with others
						is part of what nourishes a person&apos;s spiritual life.
						Connecting gives us a sense of meaning and purpose.</p>

					<h3>Tips for Beating Isolation</h3>
					<p>Being around others is important for spiritual and personal
						well-being. Withdrawing from people affects spiritual fitness
						because without connection, life can feel meaningless. You can
						beat isolation by:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Making plans ahead of time to socialize with others.
							Stick to the plan even if your impulse is to be alone.</li>
						<li>Committing to leaving the house for at least thirty
							minutes a day and go to a location where you will find other
							people (grocery store, post office, bank, etc.).</li>
						<li>Spending time with people you trust in places you feel
							comfortable.</li>
						<li>Being in places where you&apos;re around people but
							don&apos;t have to interact much, like a church service or
							concert.</li>
						<li>Going on short outings. Gradually increase how long you
							stay out with each outing.</li>
						<li>Doing things with people where your attention is on the
							activity instead of the person, like volunteering, playing a game
							or sport, working on a project, or going to a movie.</li>
						<li>Increasing your comfort zone and taking small risks with
							someone you trust.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Reconnecting with Your Spirituality</h3>
					<p>Learning to make sense of what happened can rebuild your
						sense of purpose and reconnect you with your spirituality.
						Connecting with your spirituality improves your quality of life
						and helps you recover and rebuild healthier life conditions.
						Things you can do to restore some balance and help you to find
						meaning in traumatic events include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Share your thoughts, feelings and questions with
							counselors, chaplains, or someone you trust. They can help you
							rebuild your beliefs and find meaning. Talk about what led you to
							stop trusting in the first place. For many people, the anger and
							fear begin to dissolve once they talk and feel heard.</li>
						<li>Become more aware of what you say to yourself. Weed out
							the unrealistic thoughts and beliefs and plant thoughts that are
							more accurate.</li>
						<li>Spend time thinking, expressing, and making sense of the
							experience through talking, writing, art, music, or other means.
						</li>
						<li>Practice your spirituality to feel more connected and
							focused on what is important to you.</li>
						<li>Spend time in nature or with animals.</li>
					</ul>
