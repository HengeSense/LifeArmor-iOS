					<h3>Deployment Challenges for Parents</h3>
					<p>Service members with children face additional challenges
						when deploying. For single parents, or dual military families with
						both parents deployed, reliable childcare must be found. Some
						families relocate to be closer to additional childcare support,
						such as extended family, for the duration of the deployment. Even
						when children remain at home with the non-deployed parent, the
						effects of separation can be significant. The impacts of a
						deployment vary depending on the stage of the deployment cycle and
						the age of the child. By being aware of common reactions to
						deployments and learning ways to manage these reactions, every
						family member can help keep the family strong.</p>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>The Emotional Cycle of Deployment</h3>
					<p>The Emotional Cycle of Deployment has five stages. These
						stages span the entire deployment process, from initial
						notification to several months after returning home. Each
						deployment stage has unique emotional challenges.</p>
					<p>The five stages of the Emotional Cycle of Deployment are:</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Pre-Deployment:</b> From receiving deployment orders
							to the day of departure.</li>
						<li><b>Deployment:</b> Typically the first month a service
							member is deployed.</li>
						<li><b>Maintenance:</b> The majority of the deployment.</li>
						<li><b>Redeployment:</b> The month before the deployed
							service member or parent is expected to return home.</li>
						<li><b>Post-deployment:</b> Begins the moment the deployed
							service member is reunited with family and lasts for about two to
							five months of readjustment.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>1. Pre-Deployment Stage: What to Expect</h3>
					<p>The pre-deployment stage often includes:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Negotiation:</b> Children are often worried about
							their parent leaving and will try to talk them into staying home.
							They may negotiate by saying things like, &quot;You don&apos;t
							really have to go, do you Mommy?&quot; or, &quot;Daddy, if
							I&apos;m a really good girl will you stay home?&quot;</li>
						<li><b>Getting affairs in order:</b> Many difficult
							preparations and decisions will need to be made before a
							deployment. These may include determining who will be responsible
							for tasks the deployed parent usually does, finding childcare,
							changing financial arrangements, etc.</li>
						<li><b>Grief:</b> It&apos;s common for families to feel
							intense sadness or loss when faced with life without a parent for
							a period of time.</li>
						<li><b>Arguments:</b> It&apos;s normal in stressful times for
							people to be more irritable and on edge.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Tips for the pre-deployment stage:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Explain why you are deploying.</b> Make sure children
							understand that the upcoming deployment is part of your job. Kids
							need to be assured that their parent is not leaving because of
							anything they&apos;ve done wrong. You can tell them you are going
							to help people who live far away. Remind your children that you
							love and appreciate them.</li>
						<li><b>Family time.</b> Don&apos;t ignore your
							children&apos;s needs while you&apos;re busy preparing for the
							deployment. Plan some fun family outings so everyone can spend
							quality time together before you leave.</li>
						<li><b>Communicate expectations.</b> Discuss how life will be
							different, but how you have faith in the children's ability to
							carry out responsibilities. Discussions like these will help kids
							realize they are an important part of the family, and they share
							a responsibility in helping the family survive.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>2. Deployment Stage: What to Expect</h3>
					<p>Here are some common deployment stage experiences:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Mixed emotions:</b> It&apos;s typical for all family
							members to deal with a roller coaster of emotions, including
							anger, sadness, fear, pride, excitement and anxiety.</li>
						<li><b>Feeling numb:</b> In the first month of the service
							member&apos;s absence, over-whelming emotions may lead to numb
							feelings in all family members.</li>
						<li><b>Sadness:</b> Family members may grieve the emotional
							and physical hole left in the household by the deployed service
							member.</li>
						<li><b>Difficulty sleeping:</b> Strong emotions and household
							changes make it difficult to relax enough to sleep.</li>
						<li><b>Not feeling safe:</b> When a parent departs, many
							children feel less safe and secure because of the change in
							family structure.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Tips for the deployment stage:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Spend extra time with your kids.</b> The remaining
							parent/caregiver should spend extra time helping the kids during
							this transition. While it&apos;s important to be honest about the
							service member&apos;s deployment activities, it&apos;s okay to
							put a positive spin on the job to prevent the children from
							getting overly worried about their parent.</li>
						<li><b>Pre-written, pre-stamped postcards.</b> The deployed
							parent should take some pre-written, pre-stamped postcards while
							traveling. Receiving these will help your kids feel connected
							until more permanent communications are set up.</li>
						<li><b>Continue family traditions and create new ones.</b>
							Family routines and traditions help stabilize the family. So keep
							celebrating Friday pizza nights or Saturday outings even after a
							parent deploys. If you don&apos;t have any family traditions, now
							is a great time to start one! Encourage your children to talk
							about these kinds of events and activities with the deployed
							parent.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>3. Maintenance Stage: What Families with Children Can
						Expect</h3>
					<p>Expect these common experiences in the maintenance stage:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>New routines</b> will be <b>established:</b> Remaining
							family members/caregivers will create new ways to run the
							household (housework, shopping, helping with homework,
							recreational activities) to adjust to the service member&apos;s
							absence and to feel &quot;normal&quot; again.</li>
						<li><b>New sources of support are discovered:</b> Family,
							friends, playgroups, community gatherings and religious/spiritual
							activities offer great connections and community for the family.
						</li>
						<li><b>Less anxiety as the family gets used to the
								transition:</b> As challenges arise, family members learn to cope
							with crises and make important decisions. The children will begin
							to feel safer and more secure.</li>
						<li><b>Independence:</b> While family members continue to
							miss the service member, they become independent and live happy,
							successful lives during the deployment.</li>
						<li><b>Some problems might intensify:</b> While most families
							adjust well, some worries, negative feelings, or difficult
							behaviors may continue. If these problems persist, struggling
							family members should seek help.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Tips for the maintenance stage:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Communicate with the deployed parent.</b> As the
							family settles into their new routine, it is important that
							communication continues as much as possible with the deployed
							parent. Families should establish a communication schedule. A
							schedule makes it easier for the family to be available when the
							deployed parent calls and allows the family to anticipate and
							look forward to the calls.</li>
						<li><b>Communicate on important days.</b> Service members
							should make a special effort to contact the family on or around
							birthdays, anniversaries and other important dates. If this
							isn&apos;t possible, leaving a &quot;back-up&quot; card with a
							pre-written note inside will help everyone feel connected on
							special days.</li>
						<li><b>Make plans for the family to grow together.</b>
							Don&apos;t put life on hold until the deployed parent returns.
							Set specific goals for each of the children and yourself. Record
							and report the progress on each goal, so the deployed parent can
							be part of that progress by providing encouragement.</li>
						<li><b>Help children understand deployment is temporary.</b>
							You may not know exactly how long the deployment will last, but
							you can estimate when the deployed parent might return home. Once
							you know the return date, help your children create a
							&quot;Countdown Calendar.&quot; The calendar should include
							events, such as holidays and family outings that help break the
							time a parent is deployed into shorter time periods.</li>
						<li><b>Address children&apos;s questions and worries as
								truthfully as possible.</b> Be open when talking with your children
							about the deployed parent and ask your children what prompted
							their questions or concerns. Reassure them about military
							training and protection, without making false promises about the
							safety or well-being of the deployed parent.</li>
						<li><b>Keep a close relationship with the school and
								teachers.</b> Schedule regular meetings with teachers,
							administrators and counselors. Let them know about the deployment
							so they understand the extra stress the child is facing.
							Educators can help you to recognize signs of stress in the
							children</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>4. Redeployment Stage: What to Expect</h3>
					<p>These are some common experiences in the re-deployment
						stage:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Anticipation of homecoming:</b> Like the deployment
							stage, children may have mixed emotions during the homecoming
							period. This is common and normal.</li>
						<li><b>Excitement:</b> Excited children and spouses start
							making post-deployment plans (&quot;When Mommy comes home
							we&apos;ll go to the carnival&quot; or, &quot;We&apos;ll watch
							lots of movies when Daddy gets back&quot;).</li>
						<li><b>Nervousness:</b> Some children worry about how change
							will affect their deployed parent. Children may ask questions
							like, &quot;Will Mommy recognize me? Will I recognize her?&quot;
							or, &quot;Is Daddy going to be mad that we painted the house
							without him?&quot;</li>
						<li><b>Mixed emotions:</b> It is normal for a child to
							confuse pride (about accomplishments while the parent was gone)
							and concern (that the parent may feel &quot;left out&quot; or not
							approve of changes made in their absence).</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Tips for redeployment stage:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Keep routines.</b> Keep your routine as normal as
							possible so children don&apos;t get anxious or feel ignored by
							preparations for the service member&apos;s return.</li>
						<li><b>Include kids in the homecoming preparations.</b> This
							will help them feel a part of the excitement of their
							parent&apos;s homecoming. Creating signs, baking a cake, making a
							card, and planning a party are great ways for kids to get
							involved.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>5. Post-Deployment Stage: What to Expect</h3>
					<p>For many families, the idea of a reunion brings up feelings
						of happiness and excitement. For others, anticipating the reunion
						creates anxiety and uncertainty. If the family had problems before
						deployment, the homecoming may cause more stress, anxiety, and
						fear. Most families feel a mix of joy and anxiety about the
						homecoming.</p>
					<p>Typically, families expect the homecoming to be a wonderful,
						problem-free time. Family members focus so much on surviving the
						deployment that they often forget to anticipate the challenges of
						homecoming. The reality of homecoming catches many families
						off-guard. Here is a typical cycle that families often experience
						following the reunion:</p>
					<b><i>Honeymoon</i>
					</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Everything seems wonderful and there is a sense of
							euphoria and relief.</li>
						<li>Focus is on family time - catching up and sharing
							experiences.</li>
						<li>Conflicts and annoyances are avoided.</li>
					</ul>
					<b><i>Adjustment</i>
					</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Pressures of daily life get stronger.</li>
						<li>More conflict and irritation with each other.</li>
						<li>Realization that changes need to be made.</li>
						<li>Roles and expectations are changed and tested.</li>
					</ul>
					<b><i>Integration</i>
					</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Adjustment in roles and expectations are made.</li>
						<li>There is a decrease in conflict.</li>
						<li>Disagreements are addressed rather than avoided.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Children react in unique ways to reuniting with a parent
						following a deployment. Some children react in ways that may upset
						the returning service member. Some children may not want to hug or
						kiss their returning parent. If the service member understands how
						children cope with homecoming, they&apos;ll avoid feeling hurt or
						upset by the child&apos;s reactions.</p>
					Tips for the post-deployment stage:
					<ul>
						<li><b>Recognize change.</b> It&apos;s important for everyone
							to realize that things won&apos;t be exactly as they were before
							the deployment.</li>
						<li><b>Reconnect.</b> Attending family gatherings, enjoying
							events as a family, and spending &quot;alone time&quot; with your
							children will help everyone reconnect.</li>
						<li><b>Clarify expectations.</b> To avoid arguments and hurt
							feelings over changing roles and routines, talk openly about
							everyone&apos;s expectations.</li>
						<li><b>Give it some time.</b> Go slowly, be patient, and
							allow several months to reestablish close family connections.
							Returning parents should slowly rebuild trust, allowing
							relationships to heal naturally and without force.</li>
						<li><b>Tell your kids how much you love them.</b> Your kids
							need to hear you say how much you missed them and how happy you
							are to see them again.</li>
						<li><b>Don&apos;t take it personally.</b> Children often say
							and do things they don&apos;t really mean when they are upset or
							confused.</li>
						<li><b>Listen sensitively to your children.</b> Show them you
							are interested and ready to hear what they have to say.</li>
						<li><b>Don&apos;t force your children to spend time with
								you.</b> Let things happen naturally. Give your children time to
							readjust to you at their pace.</li>
						<li><b>Spend time with each child individually.</b> Make a
							date with each of them.</li>
						<li><b>Limit your criticisms and judgments of your
								children.</b></li>
						<li><b>Praise your children verbally and physically for
								big and small accomplishments.</b> Tell them, &quot;Nice job!&quot;
							&quot;Wow, I&apos;m impressed,&quot; or &quot;I am so proud of
							you.&quot; You can also give your child a hug, a high five, a pat
							on the back, or a special handshake. Children cannot be
							&quot;spoiled&quot; with praise.</li>
						<li><b>Keep in mind that children mirror their parents.</b>
							If you demonstrate strength and patience, it is likely that your
							child will be strong and patient, too.</li>
						<li><b>Do not change the discipline your spouse used
								while you were away.</b> Discipline methods should be changed only
							after you and your spouse have had a chance to discuss the issue
							privately.</li>
						<li><b>Honor the relationship between your child and your
								spouse.</b> Your children were your spouse&apos;s center of
							attention while you were away. Don&apos;t abruptly demote your
							children to the number two spot upon your return.</li>
						<li><b>Learn about what&apos;s happened while you were
								away and what your child has accomplished.</b> Together look at
							pictures, home movies, scrapbooks, art work, homework, awards,
							report cards, medals, trophies, and so on.</li>
						<li><b>Bravery medals.</b> Give your children &quot;bravery
							medals&quot; for being brave while you were away.</li>
						<li><b>Show an interest in the everyday events of your
								children&apos;s lives.</b> Find out what new interests your children
							developed while you were away. Don&apos;t tease your children
							about their interests, no matter how strange they may seem to
							you. Instead, get involved in their activities.</li>
						<li><b>Remember - you are all adjusting!</b>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>New Parents</h3>
					<p>Service members who were away for the birth or first year of
						their baby&apos;s life will be coming home to a whole new family.
						There will be unique challenges in this situation that may
						include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Feelings of jealousy and/or guilt. It&apos;s possible
							that you may feel jealous of the attention your partner gives
							your baby. Or you may feel guilty for being away during the
							pregnancy and the birth of your child. You need to accept two
							facts: (1) your baby&apos;s needs demand attention; and (2) your
							deployment was unavoidable. By moving past your negative feelings
							you can take an active role in caring for your baby and your
							partner.</li>
						<li>Your partner may experience feelings of resentment toward
							you and even your baby for having to care for an infant alone.
							Express appreciation for everything done in your absence. Spend
							time together and talk about your feelings.</li>
						<li>Your baby&apos;s needs come first, and those needs are
							expensive. Now that you&apos;re home, you won&apos;t get the
							special pay you may have received while deployed. Be prepared for
							a tighter budget.</li>
						<li>Spend time with your other children. Older children may
							feel lost and angry with all of the changes. Spend quality time
							with them.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Single and Dual-Deployed Parents</h3>
					<p>Children of single parents and dual military households
						where both parents are deployed are often placed with trusted
						friends and family members for the duration of the deployment. If
						your children were placed with a caregiver outside the home,
						you&apos;ll face unique challenges. In particular, you may be
						anxious about the relationships that your children formed with
						their caregivers while you were away. You may also be worried
						about re-creating your own bond with your children. Here are some
						tips for a smoother transition with your kids:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Communicate openly and frequently with your children and
							their caregiver before and after you come home. Make sure the
							caregiver is actively involved in the transition. Separating from
							the caregiver may be difficult for your children. Keep your kids
							in touch with the caregiver through scheduled activities,
							especially in the first month after coming home.</li>
						<li>Talk with the caregiver about your children&apos;s new
							routines and schedules. Learn the caregiver&apos;s rules and
							disciplining methods. Try to integrate this information into your
							own routines, schedules, and rules. This will help ease the
							transition for you and your children.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Soldiers Experiencing Combat Stress or PTSD</h3>
					<p>If you&apos;re having a tough time with combat stress
						reactions or you&apos;ve been diagnosed with PTSD, you may be more
						worried and uncertain about spending time with your kids. You may
						worry about how you&apos;ll react to your children or how
						they&apos;ll react to you. You may also worry about &quot;keeping
						it together&quot; in front of your family. Your concerns are
						normal and they reflect your desire to be a good parent. Here are
						some additional ways to help the entire family when you come home:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b><i>Take care of yourself.</i>
						</b> Continue any treatments you&apos;ve started or seek out
							appropriate treatment.</li>
						<li><b>Teach your children about PTSD using
								age-appropriate language.</b> Teach them what to expect. Assure them
							that you&apos;re working to overcome your problems. You can say
							things like this: &quot;Sometimes when people have this, they
							want to be by themselves or they may be grouchy. I may be like
							that sometimes. I want you to know that even if I am, it&apos;s
							not your fault, and I love you very much.&quot; You may take your
							anger out on your children. Tell your children that your problems
							are not their fault. For example, you may yell at them because
							they made a mess or are making too much noise. If this happens,
							calm yourself down and apologize. Let your kids know your anger
							was not their fault. Tell them you&apos;re working hard and
							getting help to feel better.</li>
						<li><b><i>Assure the children that their feelings are
									normal and valid.</i>
						</b> They may be angry, confused, sad, ashamed, or afraid. They may
							direct their negative emotions toward you. Patiently accept their
							reactions.</li>
						<li><b><i>Seek support from friends, family, school,
									church, etc.</i>
						</b> You should not carry this burden yourself.</li>
						<li><b><i>Keep enjoying fun activities.</i>
						</b> Stay involved in physical activities with your children, such as
							camping, playing ball, or hiking.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Soldiers with Physical Injuries</h3>
					<p>If you have sustained a brain injury or another physical
						injury while deployed, you may be worried about spending time with
						your children. If you need lots of medical attention, you may
						worry about how your children will react to the doctor&apos;s
						visits and the equipment. You may wonder how your kids will react
						to your injuries, especially if the injuries have changed the way
						you look or act. If you have an injury with no visible wounds, you
						may have difficulty communicating to your children why you
						can&apos;t do certain things even though you look okay. You may
						worry about how you&apos;ll relate to and play with your kids.
						These are normal concerns-they show you care about your
						relationship with your family.</p>
					<p>If you did sustain an injury, here are some ways you can
						help both yourself and your family after returning home:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b><i>Take care of yourself, physically and
									mentally.</i>
						</b> It&apos;s important to continue your medical care, or seek
							behavioral health support if you suffer from combat stress,
							depression, or anxiety.</li>
						<li><b><i>Before you return home, discuss the
									injuries with your kids over the phone.</i>
						</b> Send them a picture of you or talk over a webcam so they know
							what you look like with your injury. Involve their caregiver in
							preparing your children for your return home.</li>
						<li><b><i>After returning, teach your children about
									your injuries.</i>
						</b> Use age-appropriate language. If appropriate, show your children
							your injury. Let them know what to expect as you heal. Involve
							your spouse in these conversations, too.</li>
						<li><b><i>Tell your children that their feelings are
									normal and valid.</i>
						</b> They may be angry, confused, sad, ashamed, or afraid. They also
							may be proud of your injuries. They may direct their negative
							emotions toward you. Or they may try to shield you from
							everything negative. Whatever their reactions, be patient and
							accept their emotions.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div data-role="collapsible" data-collapsed="true">
					<h3>Responses to Separation at Different Ages</h3>
					<p>There are some common reactions to separation depending on a
						child&apos;s age. Each child will have their own unique reaction,
						but learning guidelines can help you understand your child&apos;s
						reaction.</p>
					Infants (ages 0-1):
					<ul>
						<li>Infants must be held and actively nurtured. If the
							caregiver gets depressed during the service member&apos;s
							deployment, the infant may fuss a lot or have less energy and
							interest in what&apos;s going on around them. They may also lose
							weight by refusing to eat. In these cases, a pediatrician should
							evaluate the baby right away. The caregiver should also monitor
							their emotional and physical health and may need to seek
							professional care if they have difficulty adjusting or are
							feeling depressed.</li>
						<li><b><i>What can the deployed parent do?</i>
						</b> By supporting the caregiver, the deployed service member can help
							care for an infant negatively affected by the separation.
							Letters, e-mails, postcards and photos are powerful ways to
							communicate love, affection, and support to the caregiver who may
							be lonely and depressed.</li>
					</ul>
					Toddlers (ages 1-3):
					<ul>
						<li>Toddlers tend to copy the attitudes and behaviors of
							their caregivers. If the caregiver is coping well, the child will
							tend to do well. If the caregiver has emotional difficulties, a
							toddler may become gloomy, tearful, throw tantrums, or develop
							sleep problems. Children usually respond positively to more
							attention, hugs and holding hands. The caregiver might benefit
							from sharing their experiences with others facing similar
							challenges.</li>
						<li><b><i>What can the deployed parent do?</i>
						</b> Toddlers can identify people in photos and understand that a
							person still exists even when they are not present. The deployed
							parent should send updated photos and communicate directly with
							the child through letters, e-mails and postcards. Some of the
							deployed parent&apos;s letters can be read by the caregiver much
							like a bedtime story.</li>
					</ul>
					Preschoolers (ages 3-6):
					<ul>
						<li>Preschoolers with negative reactions to a parent&apos;s
							deployment may act younger than their age. They may have
							difficulty with potty training, begin bed-wetting, revert to baby
							talk and thumb-sucking, want to sleep in the parents&apos; bed,
							and so forth. They may also seem irritable, depressed,
							aggressive, clingy, and frightened that the caregiver will leave
							them. The caregiver should reassure children with extra attention
							and by maintaining family routines. Answers to their questions
							about deployment should be brief and matter-of-fact. This will
							help to reduce the anxiety caused by a child&apos;s overactive
							imagination.</li>
						<li><b><i>What can the deployed parent do?</i>
						</b> Younger preschoolers respond well to visual stimulation. Sending
							cards, photos, funny images, and colorful pictures may really
							cheer them up. If you have an older preschooler learning to read,
							you can write short, simple notes to help them practice reading.
							These notes will help them feel connected and make them proud of
							their abilities as well.</li>
					</ul>
					School-age children (ages 6-12):
					<ul>
						<li>School-age children may whine, complain, become
							aggressive, or act out their feelings. They may focus on the
							deployed parent missing a key event, such as &quot;If Daddy
							really loved me, he&apos;d be here for my birthday.&quot; Some
							signs of difficulty adjusting may include: sleep problems, loss
							of interest in school, not eating or eating too much, and not
							playing with friends. They should be encouraged to talk about
							their feelings and will need more attention (hugs, joint
							activities, help with homework) than usual. Stick to family
							routines as much as possible to help them feel more safe and
							secure. Keeping school-age children involved in extra-curricular
							activities is also a good idea.</li>
						<li><b><i>What can the deployed parent do?</i>
						</b> Celebrate birthdays and other important events, like good report
							cards or sports achievements. Buy birthday presents, cards and
							other gifts before deploying. This way, your child will feel
							special, opening something you picked out. Writing detailed
							letters directly to the older school-aged child will also help
							them feel important and connected to you.</li>
					</ul>
					Teenagers (ages 13-18):
					<ul>
						<li>Teenagers may rebel, fight, and seek attention in
							unhealthy ways. They may lose interest in school, peers, and
							activities. They also run an increased risk of experimenting with
							unsafe sex, alcohol, and drugs. Since teens often deny their
							problems and worries, the caregiver must stay actively involved
							and talk about life issues with teens regularly. If a
							teenager&apos;s grades suffer, be patient and look for ways to
							help improve things. Encourage teens to get involved in sports or
							other social activities that can provide some structure to their
							life. Find ways to give them more family responsibilities so they
							feel important and needed.
						<li><b><i>What can the deployed parent do?</i>
						</b> E-mails and letters show that deployed parents understand a
							teenager&apos;s frustration. Through e-mails and letters, you can
							also explain your expectations of your teen as a young adult.
							Teenagers need to understand you expect them to act maturely,
							help around the house, and support the rest of the family. You
							should also encourage your teen to express their feelings in
							letters and e-mails to you. Teens generally respond well to a
							balance of love and boundaries.</li>

					<h3>The Adjustment of the Remaining Parent or Caregiver</h3>
					<p>Deployment often creates stressful circumstances for the
						remaining parent/caregiver. They may have to take over new roles
						and responsibilities. For example, they may have to adjust to a
						reduced income or separation from close friends and a supportive
						community if they relocated. Deployment may even create or
						increase tension in the relationship with the deployed parent.</p>
					<p>Children look to their caregivers as examples. If caregivers
						struggle to cope with these new demands, the children will likely
						struggle as well. Children adjust better when they see their
						caregivers cope with the separation, manage the household, and
						stay involved socially.</p>

					<h3>Helping Caregivers Cope during Stressful Times</h3>
					<p>If you&apos;ve flown on an airplane, you&apos;ve heard the
						flight attendant tell parents, in the event of an emergency, to
						secure their own oxygen mask before securing a child&apos;s oxygen
						mask. In the same way, caregivers should first manage their own
						care and support before addressing the needs of the children.</p>
					Here are some self-care tips for the caregiver.
					<ul>
						<li><b><i>Schedule time for yourself.</i>
						</b> Create a schedule with special time for you. You&apos;ll have
							more energy and be in better spirits if you take time to
							exercise, nap, spend time alone, or take time with a good
							supportive friend. These activities can be brief, but planned.
							Thank the kids for giving you time to yourself. Let them know how
							much better you feel.</li>
						<li><b><i>Communicate with other families.</i>
						</b> Join a support group of parents with deployed spouses. Talking
							with people who are facing similar experiences helps!</li>
						<li><b><i>Tell the children why you are upset.</i>
						</b> Children tend to focus more of their concern on their caregiver.
							If children know why their at-home parent is emotional, they can
							accept the situation much more easily. *NOTE: Don&apos;t share
							all the details of your concerns or problems with your children.
							Use good judgment and share just the things that will ease your
							child&apos;s worries.</li>
