					<h3>What Is Stress?</h3>
					<p>Stress is a normal physical response to events that make you
						feel threatened or upset your balance in some way. When you sense
						danger, whether it&apos;s real or imagined, the body&apos;s
						defenses kick into a high gear in a rapid, automatic process known
						as the &quot;fight-or-flight&quot; reaction, or the stress
						response. Minor hassles, serious challenges, painful memories, and
						even positive events can all cause your body to go into this
						stress response mode and prepare to either fight the threat or run
						from it. Once you recognize the sources of your stress, you will
						be able to anticipate and manage your stress more effectively.</p>

					<h3>How Can I Reduce Stress?</h3>
					Strategies to reduce stress depend on whether you have control over
					the stressful situation. These strategies are described in detail
					on the following screens. Remember to seek support from friends and
					loved ones. They are some of your greatest allies against stress.

					<h3>
						Stress-reduction Strategies If You <i>Don&apos;t</i> Have Control
						over the Stressful Situation
					</h3>
					<span class="underlined_text">Emotion-Focused Activities</span><br>
					When faced with challenges outside your control try one of these
					strategies:
					<ul>
						<li>Listen to music, read a book, or watch a movie.</li>
						<li>Get together with a friend.</li>
						<li>Get some exercise.</li>
						<li>Engage in spiritual activities.</li>
						<li>Try yoga or meditation.</li>
						<li>Take a nap or relaxing bath.</li>
						<li>Write in a journal or diary.</li>
						<li>Express your stress creatively (painting, playing a
							musical instrument).</li>
						<li>Help others in need or volunteer.</li>
						<li>Practice &quot;anxiety surfing&quot; (riding out
							anxieties until they naturally subside).</li>
					</ul>
					<span class="underlined_text">Mental Reframing</span><br>
					Everyone has a constant stream of thoughts running through their
					minds-this is called self-talk. Self-talk reflects your beliefs
					about the world and yourself. Negative self-talk can be a stressor.
					Mental reframing is a process that helps you interrupt negative
					self-talk and challenge it with more realistic, positive thoughts.
					There are five steps in mental reframing:
					<ol>
						<li><b>Practice self-monitoring:</b> monitor your thoughts to
							spot unhelpful or negative self-talk.</li>
						<li><b>Use the ABC model</b> (<b><i>A</i>
						</b>ctivating event + <b>B</b>eliefs = <b><i>C</i>
						</b>onsequences): identify the situation (<b><i>a</i>
						</b>ctivating event) and your <b><i>b</i>
						</b>eliefs and thoughts about it. Recognize the <b><i>c</i>
						</b>onsequence or affect of those thoughts on your feelings and
							behavior. Often your interpretation of a situation can lead to a
							stress reaction.</li>
						<li><b>Identify negative thought patterns:</b> recognize when
							your beliefs about a situation are unhelpful or unrealistic.
							Common negative thought patterns include:
							<ol id="ol_letters">
								<li><b>All-or-Nothing Thinking:</b> seeing things in black
									and white, &quot;<i>good</i>&quot; or &quot;<i>bad</i>&quot;
									terms when there is clearly a middle ground. An example is
									thinking that you are <i>either</i> perfect or a failure.</li>
								<li><b>Exaggeration:</b> blowing the imagined consequences
									of an event out of proportion. You may see minor problems as
									&quot;horrible&quot; or &quot;disastrous&quot; but others may
									say you&apos;re making a mountain out of a molehill.</li>
								<li><b>Overgeneralization:</b> taking an isolated
									experience and drawing general, often negative conclusions. For
									example, believing that if one person turns you down for a date
									that you will <i>always</i> be rejected or that you will <i>never</i>
									find the right person.</li>
								<li><b>Mind-Reading:</b> assuming you know what another
									person is thinking. For example, thinking your friends
									don&apos;t want to hear about your deployment experiences, when
									they really just feel awkward asking about it.</li>
							</ol></li>
						<li><b>Challenge negative thoughts:</b> look carefully for
							evidence that challenges negative or stressful self-talk. Ask
							yourself: Is my information reliable? Are my beliefs based on
							feelings rather than facts? Is there evidence for or against my
							stressful thoughts?</li>
						<li><b>Use positive self-talk:</b> replace negative,
							stressful self-talk with positive, empowering self-talk.</li>
					</ol>
					<span class="underlined_text">Deep Breathing and Progressive
						Muscle Relaxation </span>
					<p>
						When stressed, your breathing becomes fast and shallow and your
						muscles tense. You can interrupt this response and reduce your
						stress with deep breathing and muscle relaxation. To learn these
						techniques, try the Breathe2Relax mobile application or check out
						the Life Stress Workshop on <a

					<h3>
						Stress-reduction Strategies If You <i>Do</i> Have Control over the
						Stressful Situation
					</h3>
					<span class="underlined_text">Nine-Step Problem-Solving
						Strategy</span><br> STEP 1: Recognize Signals of Stress. These
					signals include thoughts, feelings, behavior, and physical signs.<br>
					STEP 2: Define the Problem. Find the real problem and be specific
					about how it triggers your stress reaction.<br> STEP 3: Set a
					Goal. Set a specific goal for dealing with the stressor.<br>
					STEP 4: Brainstorm Possible Solutions. When you brainstorm,
					don&apos;t judge any of the solutions. Just let them flow and write
					them down. Be creative!<br> STEP 5: Evaluate Possible
					Solutions. Weigh the pros and cons of each possible solution you
					just brainstormed.<br> STEP 6: Choose the Best Possible
					Solutions Based on Pros and Cons. Give special consideration to the
					solution with the <i>least</i> cons.<br> STEP 7: Make a Plan
					and Try Your Solution. Create a step-by-step plan for achieving
					your solution. Set deadlines (time and date) for the completion of
					each step.<br> STEP 8: Assess the Solution. Ask yourself if
					you met your goal.<br> STEP 9: If the First Solution
					Didn&apos;t Work? Try another solution from your list.
